The young generation gather in the young hawk pavilion,

which stands alone in an area of several thousand square meters.

in the lobby many disciples are doing their breathing exercises, at

this time in the spacious hall, dozens of disciples of the spirit gathering

stage can be seen.

It was still early , so the foundation building seniors responsible

for the gathering have not yet come, so the disciples gathered in groups

of twos and threes to talks about things of interest.

Lin Xuan quietly sitting cross-legged, taking advantaged of the time

provided to cultivate for a while, hears people come around the corner.

“Oh, isn’t that Brother Lin?”

“I heard you went into closed door practice a while ago, wasn’t it to breakthrough to the second layer?”

Lin Xuanwei’s brows wrinkled with his taunting laughter, while maintaining a unemotional surface. In the eyes of mortals, cultivators are truly extraordinary and immortals, how ever that is only the outside appearance of it, cultivators also need to gain insights profound teachings.

The cultivating world is in reality more cruel than the secular, more realistic, and infinitely more snobbish.

But unlike the secular world, the world of cultivators is based only on strength, and the most powerful stand tall.

Those with the highest cultivation, those with the best skills, those who are truly immortal, are the ones in charge, only they have the right to speak.

Three years, although Lin Xuan’s efforts were higher than the others, since he had no spiritual roots he was left far behind by the others and left out in the cold.

“Well, with the spirit roots of a mortal, no matter how hard working he works, cannot be compared with us, rather he’s a disgrace to our sect.

“ Oh yes, three years and unable to breakthrough into the second layer, truly a waste.”

…..

Faced with the ridicule of his brothers, Lin Xuan did not bat an eyelid, and looked the same as usual, after giving those silly guys a cold look, Lin Xuan went over to the side.

Not out of anger, or fear, but because those few shallow guys who ran their tongues were not worth the effort, and were unable to affect his state of mind.

He once again sat down cross-legged, and began to absorb spiritual power again, and after another half hour, a bell rang out, the disciples all stopped what they were doing and talking about, and started to line up, with Lin Xuan all the way in the back.

A middle-aged man walked, who on the surface, looked no more than forty years, but was certainly older than that, as with the higher cultivation levels, life will also be extended as the aging gradually slows down.

“Master!”

All the disciples bowed down, in accordance to the rules of whirlwind cloud valley, they must show respect to the one sent to teach them.

“My name is Zhang Yu, you are to learn to use Spirit Shield.”

Spirit Shield, by definition, is when spiritual power is gathered and distributed over the body surface to form a cloak, it is the most basic of defensive spell.

The Disciples excitedly, started to whisper among themselves.

Except Lin Xuan who was like an ordinary person, the disciples with spirit roots, after cultivating the past three years, had reached the third and fourth layers, and were mid-stage Spirit Gathering disciples, and had earned the right to learn basic spells.

“Such noise, quiet!” After seeing the undisciplined group, Zhang Yu had an ugly expression.

After seeing their senior angry, the disciples immediately shut their mouths.

Zhang Yu then began to explain in detail how to control the spiritual power, which requires a very high attention to detail.

Lin Xuan listened very carefully, in fact, as he was now recovering, his spirit power was not enough to use spirit shield, but knowing as long as he learns the method to practice the spell, he will be able to remember it in the future and slowly practice.

“Good,now go practice on your own.” After Zhang Yu finished giving instructions, he left the young hawk pavilion, wondering how their practice would go, after seeing various promising disciples.

Lin Xuan also left, heading first for his residence, a small log cabin that has a high spirit power density, but it is a very simple living area for low level disciples.

The house has few pieces of furniture, a table, chair, and a wooden bed, Lin Xuan opened a drawer on the desk, and after taking out a pen and paper, wrote down the cultivation method for the spirit shield he just learned.

This is a habit he has developed over the past three years, since he lacked spirit roots and couldn keep pace with the the others in term of cultivation speed, he always wrote down what he learned everytime one of his senior’s taught something, Lin Xuan has by now recorded many things that he heard but is unable to practice, so he leaving it all for the future by writing it down to prevent himself from forgetting.

After finishing writing, Lin Xuan carefully put away the book, and started to make his way back to the inner area to continue cultivating, and after two days arrived at the training ground.

Even with the increasing spirit power, Lin Xuan stopped there, as he can go no further, since the deeper one goes into the inner area, the more terrifying the illusions.

With the sound of rushing wind, the scene changes, all around is a wide world of ice and snow, the wind cutting into him like ten thousand blades of ice.

The snow is soon covering his ankle, his whole body frozen in just a moment, Lin Xuan watches all this with a cold heart, wondering at the random change in the illusions, first having him bear the pain of fire, and now the endless cold.

After staring blanky for a moment, Lin Xuan sits down cross-legged, and begins absorbing spirit power.

As his body froze, Lin Xuan’s hair condensed into icicles, but still he sat motionless in the snow, enduring for more than twenty minutes before he ran out of the illusion to rest, warming his body to increase recovery speed, soon returning to cultivation.

……….

The cold wind, soon condensed the snow into sharp stakes of ice that flew over to Lin Xuan, and still you can see a rock-still teenager on the floor cultivating.

Two days later, Lin Xuan quickly stood up, hesitating to continue cultivating, as the spirit power here was not pure and enough, to break through he would have to deeper inside. Strengthening his resolve, Lin Xuan turned towards the depths and…..
