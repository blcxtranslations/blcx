“Here is your token”

a forty year old low-order cultivator tossed the identification

plate into Lin Xuan’s hands, with an indifferent expression,

after judging Lin Xuan to be no more than an average youth,

getting sent to the trash pill storage, a position usually given to

the most useless people, as it had no requirements, this youth was

obviously tricked by old Feng.

Looking at Lin Xuan with contempt in his eyes, he failed t

o notice that Lin Xuan was happy about his posting, who was as

usual pretending to appear unaware.

“Thank you, Senior”

Lin Xuan looked at the plate in his hand, a half-palm sized piece of jade with the words “trash pill storage” written on one side, and the word “Steward” on the other side.

This was to represent his position, and with it even someone could get into the first area of Danxia Mountain unimpeded with free access to the trash pill room.

Danxia Mountain as a key area of the school was divided into three areas.

The first area containing the trash pill storage, wherein the second area contains the fire alchemy rooms, and the third area being the storage area for all finished products as well as all sorts of immortal herbs making it one of the most important locations, guarded by various barriers and numerous checkpoints.

The first area, other than containing the trash pill storage area, also contains a reception room, as well as various areas for the few odd jobs required, and since Lin Xuan now possessed the identification plate, he could freely move throughout the first area.

Holding the Plate, Lin Xuan’s heart is filled with joy, but he still maintains a dull expression maintaining his facade.

And as he came out of the room, he went towards the first area holding the identification plate, and the demeanor of a rookie who understood nothing of the world fell away without a trade. Replaced with a mature youth who held a slight mocking smile.

Steward of Trash Pill Storage, finally achieving his goal with only having to pay the price of spirit stone fragments, Lin Xuan was finally able to secure a source of trash pills without causing any undue attention on himself.

After a moment of silent contemplation, Lin Xuan took out a jade plate, injecting his soul into it, it was a map of the first area of Danxia Mountain, with explanations of the different areas as pointing out the forbidden areas.

After taking a look around, Lin Xuan found the entrance to the storage area and walked past it.

“Trash pills truly are considered worthless by others, the other areas actually have a few barriers and protections, but this storage area actually has nothing.” As Lin Xuan walked around, the more he understood just how little regard other cultivators held for trash pills, which in the end just made things more convenient for him.

After walking around for about a quarter of an hour, Lin Xuan finally came to the trash storage room, which stood in a courtyard among some other buildings, the biggest one being the storehouse, followed by the living areas for the steward and his assistant.

It was a relatively simple layout, and possessed a lot of space, After taking a look around Lin Xuan nodded with satisfaction and directly entered the courtyard.

In the courtyard there were several fifteen-year old boys sitting around bored, as apparently there had been no new people for a long time, so as they saw Lin Xuan coming they were surprised, but after noticing that he wore the clothing of a cultivator the immediately showed respectful expressions, and ran up to offer greetings, with the one who seemed the oldest stepping forward.

“Immortal, what makes you come here?”

“What is your name?”

“This junior is called Zhao Ming.” As the youth quickly responds to Lin Xuan, it is apparent that he is offering his utmost respect.

The other boy doesn’t even dare to be disrespectful, making Lin Xuan understand fully the feeling of superiority, the feeling of being a cut above everyone else, since in the eyes of normal people cultivators are superior beings, a truly comfortable feeling.

“You are the leader?”

“Yes!” Zhao answered truthfully. “This junior here is the proxy steward.”

“proxy steward?” Lin Xuan is startled, since even though it is an odd job, the duties of the steward has always been meant for a cultivator, not an outer disciple…

Thinking that Lin Xuan was doubting him, Zhao smiles: “Upon my honor, immortal, Trash pill storage stewardship has been vacant for a long time, and because there have been no new steward assigned this junior has been looking after things.

“I see.” Lin Xuan nodded that he understood, no one has any use for trash pills, so new stewards are reluctant to come.

Wanting to clear the air, Lin Xuan speaks out: “I was sent to be the new steward, so the Trash room is now under my control, Here is the Identification plate, take a look.

Zhao is not stupid, and had apparently already suspected as much, so he showed no surprise at Lin Xuan’s statement, and quickly took the plate and looked it over, after which he quickly saluted: “This junior greets the steward”

“You” Lin Xuan waves his hand: “Get to your duties.”

After dismissing the other boys, Zhao was left alone: “You, show me around.”

as this was his new territory, Lin Xuan of course needs to know everything about it, Zhao nodded respectfully and began to lead the way.

“Squeeeek!”

As the heavy door slowly opened, a thick layer of dust fell onto Lin Xuan’s head, making him somewhat startled, as he looked at the mess in front of him. Piles and piles of bottles and jars lying about.

“This………this is the trash pill storage area?”

“Yes,Immortal”

“How long has it been since someone cleaned, or even organized, with such a chaotic area how do you even know how many trash pills there are?”

“This…….” Zhao had no response, after a moment of silence he cautiously responded: “Immortal, it is not clear exactly how many trash pills there are here, as the accounts table has not been filled out for a long time.”

“How is that possible, weren’t you the steward here, how could you not know anything?”

“Immortal this is……” as looked at Lin Xuan’s expression he carefully measured his words: “Since the impurity level in trash pills is so high that cultivators are unable to use it, making it harmful to the body, even though they are not thrown away, no one really cares about the trash pills, so it eventually became a chaotic heap that is naturally very messy, since no one would bother to account for something that no one cares for, it has always been like this, Thundercloud valley has thousands of years of history, and the Trash pill storage has always been like this, since the trash pills are useless, who cares how many there are.
