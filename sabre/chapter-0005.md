Failure!

…….

Lin Xuan sat silently for a long time, blank faced

expressing neither anger nor sadness, his hands clench

tightly, nails digging into his palm, lips also bleeding from

biting down. After a long silence, Lin Xuan took a deep breath,

then sat back down again to once again continue in his efforts.

………

Early the next morning,the sun rises, and a new day begins.

The Flying Cloud Palace, a grand and imposing building set in front of the Earth Stadium, one of the most important buildings in the  Cloud Valley, as well as one of the most important buildings there. At the start of every month, spirit gathering disciples gather there to receive training. Despite the fact that he spent the whole night cultivating, and slept for less than three hours, Lin Xuan arrives at the Flying Cloud Palace on time in the spacious hall, where hundreds of disciples have already gathered, each one a spirit gathering disciple, each one with a higher cultivation than Lin Xuan, his arrival caused the already gathered disciples to sneer and look down on him.

“Look at that trash, he has no spirit roots, but he’s trying to cultivate.”

“Well, he wont last for much longer, for trash like him to stay here, is just a waste of cultivation medicines.”

“Who said that, i heard that he works very hard, but without any spirit roots, how can he compare to us, staying in the first layer this long.”

“Such arrogance, to think that he can defy the laws of heaven and try to cultivate, it is impossible for mortals.”

……….

Arrogant!. Lin Xuan stares blankly at the other disciples, thinking nothing of their words, taking it as the wild barking of mad dogs, he just quietly stands in the back.

With the ring of a bell, the disciples quickly stopped discussions and lined up, as an old man and a little boy walked into the hall, each of the boy’s hands hold a disk, covered with a red cloth and a refreshing scent coming off of it.

“Elder Ma!” The Disciples yell, while bowing.

“Oho.” The proud old man looks happy, his is not high, he is only at the early foundation building stage, but he was in charge of the Medicinal Hall, so he had a high ranking.

In addition to their talent and efforts, Sprit Medicines are also essential, it can be very important because if enough pills are taken, cultivation speed becomes a lot faster, they can even be considered a shortcut, however refining them requires a combination of a lot of materials, including some rare plants, so the school can only provide the disciples with a few pills.

According to the rules, Spirit Gathering disciples will receive two Purifying Essence Pills.

Purifying Essence Pills, as the name implies, can cleanse the spirit power in a body, dissolving impurities and giving a little bit of spiritual power, of course, the effects vary depending on the talent of each person, even the spirit power it gives can vary greatly, the pills are also only useful to spirit gathering disciples.

As a fragrant scent spreads across the hall, the disciples thanked the elder, and began to approach in a line to receive the pills from the old man, they all had expressions of joy and happiness on their face.

Lin Xuan’s quickly arrives in front of Elder Ma, who after showing an expression of disdain removes the cover from the second disk and throws two pills at Lin Xuan.

“Thank You.” Lin Xuan yells, his eyebrows however suddenly jump up, looking at the two pills in his hand, they are…… trash pills?

Cultivators are not all the same, there are scholars, fighters, alchemists, and magic users, among many others, each one requiring vast amounts of knowledge.

For example alchemy, in addition to requiring a variety of precious materials, you also need extremely hot flames to refine them in a cauldron, with careful amounts over a long period of time, the quality of the materials also affects the success rate of alchemy.

Even experienced master alchemists, often fail while using high-quality materials, creating Trash pills, which have no use.

Trash pills are pills with excessive impurities, and to cultivators not only do they have no benefit, they also damage the body, usually they are thrown away.

Although the Cloud Valley Sect distributes the pills tp the disciples regularly, it is only a small school, and the pills are only low-grade, even low-grade pills are still useful, but this trash pill……

The Elder obviously intended to embarrass him, however Lin Xuan snaps out of his shock, and retains his composure, it is unwise to say anything, as Elder Ma holds a high position and is unwise to offend.

“Elder, are you not wrong, these two pills are trash, how can i take this?”

“What is wrong?” Elder Ma’s disdain for Lin Xuan is clear, a low-level disciple is not worth the effort, he said while raising his nose “What, not satisfied?”

“With your talents, it is a waste to take a normal pill, a trash pill might be just right for you… so be it, i am not unreasonable, just give me a few more bottles.”

Saying that he takes two white bottles from the plate, throwing them at Lin Xuan.

“The other disciples have only two purifying essence pills, i’m giving you two bottles, who else would give such favored treatment to you!”

“Thanks Elder”

Contrary to Elder Ma’s expectations, Lin Xuan’s resentment disappeared, and backed down after a respectful bow.

“But why?” Elder Ma instead had a look of shock, slumped speechlessly.

Trash pills, simply put, are garbage, taking them is detrimental to cultivators, even if you have two bottles, it just makes it even more worthless, what is Lin Xuan planning……

With that totally unexpected reaction, the elder thought that with how unfair he was treating him, Lin Xuan would shout and yell, showing disrespect to an elder, and he would be able to kick him out of the school.

Its not that Lin Xuan has offended him, and Elder Ma holds no grudges against him, but this old guy is extremely arrogant, and despises mortals with no spiritual roots, he thinks that allowing Lin Xuan to be in the school is a disgrace, so he wants to kick him out.

The plan wasn’t perfect , but he was very careful to not break any of the rules of the school. Only lower-level disciples get purifying essence pills, but he replaced Lin Xuan’s pills with trash pills, after such unfair treatment, with Lin Xuan being a teenager with far less experience than him, he expected him to attack, and as long as he did he could remove him from the school.

However, even though Lin Xuan has no spiritual roots, is just an ordinary mortal, his mind is not stupid, he’s actually very smart, he always thinks things through before acting, and is not impulsive, he is truly angry at the elder for giving him trash pills, but he is very good at hiding his emotions.

After seeing the look of disdain the elder gave him, Lin Xuan also saw a look of satisfaction, and immediately came to the conclusion that the elder was trying to remove him. Lin Xuan didn’t understand why the elder wanted to get rid of him for no reason, as he has never offended him, but that can be investigated later, the most important thing now is not falling into the trap.
