Lin Xuan next began to increase his cultivation,

since even though he had the pills to support his cultivation,

as long as he worked hard, his results would become even greater.

According to ancient records, even without spiritual roots,

as long as there are enough pills as a support, all obstacles can be

overcome in cultivating.

After determining this point, Lin Xuan will take as many pills as possible,

if it wasn’t for the medicine book recording that one cannot take more

than nine per day, he really would eat pills just like it was food.

Along with taking the pills, Lin Xuan gradually built up some experience, and decided to not waste any more pills and only take them one at a time, as his supply was limited and the effects were not ideal.

Of course, it truly impacts the bottleneck, but to eat nine all of a sudden is wrong, as although it does not exceed the limit, the results are too fast, and it makes him needlessly suffer, and since it is not easy to absorb so much that fast, the excess energy ends up being wasted.

This is clearly wasteful behavior, and not desirable.

The correct approach would be, to take three pills at a time at set intervals, and then slowly absorb the power for the best results.

Other low-level disciples, only have two pills every month, and Lin Xuan ate nine a day, at such near-luxury usage of pills, Lin Xuan’s progress was very fast, although it cannot be said to be the best, the daily growth of his spiritual power was obvious.

But good things dont last forever, and after one week, Lin Xuan ran out of purifying essence pills, although there are two left in his hand, they are higher quality pills that he got from Zhang Yu.

It is a red, pea-sized pill, a pill Lin Xuan had never seen before, of course, he would not ask any Elder,s as that would be tantamount to a confession and would show his connection with the disappearance of Zhang Yu and Zhou Yan, and so Lin Xuan quietly went out and began to once again review books, to find out which pill it is that he possessed.

Foundation Establishment Pills!

Useless to spirit gathering disciple, but valuable to a foundation building as it increased their cultivation.

Understanding what the pill was, Lin Xuan carefully hid them, putting them away for the future, the important thing now is to get more purifying essence pills, so as to continue cultivating.

Lin Xuan’s goal is the so called Trash pills.

to the west of thundercloud valley, there is a hill, but the whole of it was hollowed out, creating a huge tunnel heading deep underground, eventually leading to an active volcano mouth, with its fires used for the purpose of alchemy.

Danxia Mountain, the most important forbidden area of thundercloud valley, its importance being far above any other area.

With constant patrols, and under the supervision of many experts, all intruders are dealt with swiftly, leaving no survivors.

Even the disciples are not allowed to freely enter, and in front of the Mt Danxia there is a building which is in charge of receiving any visitors.

Before coming, Lin Xuan found out all about the circumstances, and confidently enters the building.

In Front of him lies a very spacious area, hundreds of square meters wide, with a bored boy sitting there, who quickly jumps up as he saw Lin Xuan enter, greeting him respectfully, he explained

“Immortal?”

The boy is not a thundercloud valley cultivator, but rather an outer disciple.

The so called outer disciples, are those without spiritual roots, but are talented in other areas, and so they are useful to thundercloud valley, although they are not taught any cultivation exercises, they gain other benefits.

In the eyes of mortals, cultivators are like gods to them, and even for the outer disciples, the registration is not easy, and their academic abilities were valued.

For example, the boy, although he had no spiritual roots, he was born to a family of doctors, and so he familiar with a variety of herbs and medicines, making him qualified to work in Danxia Mountain.

The school bases everything on performance, so and will reward the best with precious medical books or martial skill books, similar to the ones Lin Xuan saw in the Book Pavilion.

Although these books are not worth mentioning to cultivators and were like garbage, but where normal people are concerned, they are considered as supreme treasures. Outer Disciples after studying for eight to ten years, can then return to the normal world, and in that time they will be considered as genius doctors and masters of martial arts.

The benefits are self-evident.

Lin Xuan, although he had no spiritual roots, was received as a formal disciple, something very few outer disciples can manage, all because he managed to save a powerful and influential elder.

Although the boy did not know Lin Xuan, by just looking at his clothing, he can tell that he is a thundercloud valley cultivator, so of course, he has no intention of mocking him.

Faced with his respectful attitude, Lin Xuan’s heart held a bit of emotion, as over the past three years, he suffered the ridicules of others and was looked down upon due to his slow cultivation speed.

Although outer disciples have no spiritual roots, they are extraordinary ordinary people, but in the end they are still ordinary people and view cultivators the same as gods.

Standing high above, Lin Xuan enjoyed the feeling o being respected, which goes reaffirms Lin Xuan’s determination as a cultivator, but without batting an eyelid Lin Xuan speaks.

“ Is the steward in?”

The boy listened, and nodded his head “ The steward is in, Immortal, please take a seat, I’ll go report it.”

The boy respectfully takes Lin Xuan to a seat next to a painting, and offers tea, Lin Xuan ponders how to proceed as he drinks his tea, and soon a man walks into the room.

Gray-haired, over seventy years old, this is also a low-level cultivator, a man who had difficulty cultivating, since just having spiritual roots was not enough, as the spiritual roots also come in different quality, as well as requiring diligent work from the cultivator.

Just looking at thundercloud valley, ninety percent of the disciples, are still low-level cultivators, just like the old man in front of him, seventy-three years old, but still only at the late stage of spirit gathering, still a distance away from the peak, and even further from foundation building, it can be said he has reached the end of the line as a cultivator, so he simply no longer cultivates, and asked for a quiet place to work and relax in his comfortable old age.
