Hi everyone, sorry for the long absence. Things are starting to get more stable now, we will be starting to get back to a semblance of a regular schedule.

There won't be a chapter this week or weekend or next week, but we should be starting back up around the 9th. I am aiming for one chapter a week till August at which point I will try to get to full speed.

Thank you for your understanding and patience!
