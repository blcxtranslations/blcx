Hi everyone, sorry for not updating earlier. After coming back from China I found out that I am now unemployed.

I will be focusing on finding a job completely and therefore I won't be updating Tempered Immortal.

Hopefully I can find a job soon and get back to translating but I can't say when I will be back for sure.

I am hoping to be employed sometime in May so check back then or look out for the update announcement on Reddit.

Once again, sorry for not being able to translate and thank you everyone for understanding.
