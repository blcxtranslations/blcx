short: "Chapter release time and stock!"
---

I have added an estimated release time and current stock of translated chapters to the schedules info box on the right side. I am moving towards a 8:00PM EST chapter release time for optimal viewship and visibility. I have added in a automated counter to display how may chapters I have in 'stock' as well. Over the next month, I will try to build up the stock to at least a dozen because I have some things that will take me away from translating for about three weeks, so then they would be automatically posted when I am away.
