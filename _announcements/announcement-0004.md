Damn, what a wonderful christmas gift.

Someone reported the previous chapter headers "And give it an upvote on Reddit to get more visibility!" to the mods of /r/noveltranslations.

While I realize (because of a heads up by the mods of /r/noveltranslations) that it was against the rules of Reddit to ask for upvotes for chapter update notices, I am very sad that someone was so put off by what I did that they went straight to the mods with this. No, "Hey just a heads up, it's against the rules, you might want to change that." or anything. I literally did not know that doing so was against the rules.

The mods of /r/noveltranslations were very understanding and polite so that was nice, but it's still off putting for this to happen. It just feels so, I don't know, rude maybe, for someone to just not even let me know about it before hand.

I don't mean for this to be a rant or a sob story or to gather sympathy. I am just saying, I am human too, just give me a heads up instead of a lump of coal. If it is against the Terms of Service than I am happy to change it.

So with that said, since I can't ask for upvotes, I just wanted everyone to spread the word of the novel if you are liking it so far.
