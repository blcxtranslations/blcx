Hi everyone, hope all y'all are enjoying Tempered Immortal so far! Help spread the word if you like it!

That being said, I am going back to the great land of the web novels to see my grandparents and in-laws for the month of February.

This means that I won't be posting new chapters for this time period. There are a lot of events planned for this coming month so I will have little time to translate. So thanks everyone for understanding.

Normal pace will resume on the First of March so check back here, on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/new), or [Novel Updates](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/tempered-immortal/) in March. I also hope to be able to increase my pace a little but we will have to see how that goes.

So once again, thanks for everyone's support and see you in March!
