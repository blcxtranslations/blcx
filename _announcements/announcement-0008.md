short: "Not Permanent Hiatus?"

So some readers and fans took taking a permanent break and coming back in possibly two months to mean that I will be dropping the series.

I am sorry that that was what my title implied. I did not mean that at all. So in order to demonstrate that I really do enjoy translating this novel and would like to continue to do so, I have decided to commit to one chapter a week, releasing most likely on Sunday.

So check back on Sundays and hopefully come May, I will once again be employed and go back to a more regular and steady pace!
