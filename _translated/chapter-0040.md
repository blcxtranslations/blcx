晌午时分，
陆陆续续有修真者从外面回来，
到了用饭的时间，
低阶修真者不能辟谷，
食物由驿馆免费提供，
味道也不错。
At noon, there was a

Lin Xuan had finished eating earlier and had nothing to do. So instead of going back to his cottage, he sat in the cafeteria drinking tea.

For one, he could wait until the afternoon session started, and also, as people were having tea, they would talk about their knowledge and experiences. So as long as one paid attention, they would easily learn useful information.

Lin Xuan was on the second floor at a seat by the window. He had a casual expression while sipping his tea. It seemed like he was looking out the window enjoying the scenery. But, in fact, he was listening to the conversations around him and paying careful attention.

Though there was a lot of background noise, but to a cultivator with strong spiritual sense, it was nothing. As long as they did not use spiritual power to transmit sound, the every word could be heard clearly.

"Hey, did you go to the auction this morning?"

一个破锣般的声音
The sound of a broken gong attracted everyone's attention. Lin Xuan also glanced back. It was a burly man dressed in the coarse clothing style of rogue cultivators.

“怎么，
你老哥也参与了竞拍？”旁边的一个胖胖的少年接口道，
满脸敬仰。

The man blushed. "We rogue cultivators, do not have the strength to participate and can only go watch."

"Oh."
“哦。”众人露出原来如此的神色，
suddenly losing interest and went back to eating and drinking tea.

"Hey, listen to me."
大汉显然很有表现欲，
seeing that they were not paying attention to him, he became agitated. "Do you know, the items in the auction are real treasures. Just this morning, there were three low grade spirit tools, two mid grade spirit tools, and one high grade spirit tool."

Speaking of spirit tools, all the cultivators started to become interested. Although spirit tools were simplified magical treasures, but their magical power was great. Many Foundation Building cultivators did not even have them, so these Spirit Gathering rogue cultivators could only wishfully think of them.

Although most of these people have not personally seen them, but they have heard their elders describe spirit tools as having infinite power.

"Sigh, I did not think that spirit tools would appear. If I had known earlier, I would not have gone to wander about the stalls, but instead would have gone to see the auction. Although I cannot afford it, but at least it can be seen as increasing my worldly experience."

A cultivator with the appearance of an old in the corner coldly stated: "Hmph, do you think it's easy to watch the auction from the sidelines? If you want to get into the auction, you first have to pay one Purified Essence pill as the ticket price."

Upon hearing this, the rogue cultivators were stunned. To watch from the side would require one medicinal pill. Suddenly, everyone turned, with astonished looks in their eyes, to the man before. Some showed worship, others showed contempt. To waste precious pills for an eye opener was definitely an act of a wastrel.

但不管怀着怎样的心理，
众人对灵器越发的感兴趣，
争先打听，
大汉则口沫横飞的讲解。

"You did not see the power of the spirit tool. With just a single strike, it reduced a 500 kilogram boulder to dust, and it was only a mid grade spirit tool......"

还别说，
这大汉的性格虽然有点哗众取宠，
但口才还是很好的，
一番描述，
将众人听得悠然神往。

"Then who took this lot of spirit tools?"

"Who else could it be, of course, the mid and high grade spirit tools were taken by those powerful sects and the low grade ones were taken by those wealthy cultivator clans. Did you think that us rogue cultivators would even have a chance?"

"You're right, not only do we not have enough medicinal pills to participate in the auction, but even if we acquired it, it would be a hot potato and only invite annihilation."

This was put very bluntly, but everyone understood the point. Endlessly sighing, they also lost a lot of interest in what the man was saying. So not a lot of people heard what he said after. The afternoon auction would have even more precious treasures than the morning and included the top grade spirit tool of the patriarch of the Soaring Cloud sect and many monstrous beast eggs.

Lin Xuan lifted his cup and used the motion of drinking his tea to conceal his slight smile. Hmmm, his luck was not bad. To other Spirit Gathering stage cultivators, low grade spirit tools were only things that they might acquire buy luck. But he had three of them, the worst being mid grade, and one of them was even top grade.

Only, it he wanted to fully utilize their power, he would need the Spiritual Control technique. Think of this, Lin Xuan was even more determine to acquire this mid rank technique.

The mood in the hall was a bit low. At his moment, he heard a voice coldly say: "Hmph, what are we, the rogue cultivators, in the eyes of those sects and cultivator clans. Ignoring the fact that we can't even participate in the auction, the items brought out in the auction already have their winners decided behind the scenes."

"Deciding who would win them behind the scenes?" The cultivators were all shocked. Lin Xuan also paid attention, looking for the sound of the voice, he found it was the old man drinking in the corner by himself.

"Fellow cultivator, what did you mean by that?" Lin Xuan did not need to ask because naturally, some curious cultivators would ask for him.

The old man drank a gulp of wine and did not keep them in suspense. "The Soaring Cloud sect has five mid grade techniques. Other than the precious Jade Cloud technique being sold at the auction, the other four have all been send to the market to be sold.

Everyone nodded, this was also mentioned in the description of the treasures trade fair on the jade slip.

“可你们知不知道，
这拿出来的四本中阶功法，
其中有三本已被修真家族预定了。”

“提前预定，
这不是违反规矩吗？”

“哼，
规矩？”老者嘲讽的笑了一下：“各位来参加大会，
想必也不是刚踏入修真界的新人，
什么时候听说过修真界还要按规矩办事，
你要讲理，
那些宗派家族会与你讲吗，
还不是凭借势力，
横行霸道。”

众人默默无语，
在座的都是散修，
平时没少受门派家族的欺负，
但又能怎么样呢，
这本来就是以力服人的世界。

就算对幕后操作不满，
自己还不是没奈何。

“提前预定就提前预定吧，
反正那些中级功法，
我们这些灵动期的修士也用不上！”

“道友说得不错，
散修有几个人能够筑基成功的，
中级功法拿给我们，
也不过是废物。”

“对啊，
管他那么多，
喝酒喝酒。”
