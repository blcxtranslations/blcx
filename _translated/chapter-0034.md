Lin Xuan looked up at the steep slopes of Sky Pillar peak. According to Li Hai, the gate to the Soaring Cloud sect was at the summit. Of course, mortals would not be able to climb to it, but it would not be able to stop Lin Xuan.

Circulating his spiritual power, Lin Xuan used the Imperial Wind technique and passed over the cliffs as if walking on flat ground, easily ascending the mountain and flying towards the peak.

Although the technique was magical, but climbing five thousand metres would still take some time. On the way, Lin Xuan also saw some shadows flash past. Needless to say, these were all cultivators that wanted to participate in the treasures trade fair.

Lin Xuan did not move forward to strike up a conversation, instead, he deliberately dodged out of the way. He would not randomly approach strangers, he would be in trouble if he some more powerful people who were up to no good. The purpose of this trip was to acquire techniques rather than gain worldly experience, so the fewer troubles the better.

And like this, after almost an hour, Lin Xuan arrived at the peak. However, he could not see anything because there were layers upon layers of fog shrouding his line of sight.

Lin Xuan smiled slightly. Although he was merely a cultivator of the Spirit Gathering stage, but even he could tell with a single glance that this was the most shallow of the confusion arrays.

This kind of array, strictly speaking, could not be considered a restrictive array. Because it was too crude and too low levelled. Even Spirit Gathering stage one cultivators, if they concentrated spiritual power to their eyes, would not be affected. This array was used mainly to keep mortals away. After all, although Sky Pillar peak was very steep and treacherous, but there were still martial arts masters among mortals. If they had the proper tools, they could still be able to climb to the peak. So an array to differentiate between cultivators and mortals was placed here.

Lin Xuan was already at the middle stages of the Spirit Gathering stage, so naturally this array would not affect him. After concentrating his spiritual power, flowing it along his meridians to his eyes, the illusive fog suddenly vanished, and in front of him appeared simple teleportation array.

The reason that the teleportation array was called simple was because the movement distance of this array was very short. But this was also good because it did not require much energy to use. There was no need to use spirit stones to power it, one only needed to inject spiritual power into the eye of the array for it to work.

Standing upon the array, Lin Xuan extended his hand and injected his spiritual power into it. Suddenly, the lines and patterns of the array lit up, the surrounding scenery also turned blurry and became a vast expanse of whiteness. After all these visions disappeared, Lin Xuan had already arrived at another place.

This place seemed to be a small basin in the mountains, but it was a very open area, with a soft carpet of grass, and many blooming flowers. It was a very beautiful scene.

"Fellow cultivator must be here to participate in the treasures trade fair!"

Hearing a voice drifting over, Lin Xuan turned his head and saw a young usher. From the clothes he was wearing, one could tell that he was a member of the Soaring Cloud sect. He had a very defeated expression and seemed very feeble. But you can't blame him. The sect was forced to disband, and they had to cripple their own cultivations, becoming mortals when they used to lofty cultivators. Anyone would have a hard time just accepting it. But this was still the only way to survive.

This young cultivator could only force a smile and greet the guests. After this treasures trade fair, he would have to cripple his own cultivation.

Although he asked, there really was no point, the only people that could come to this place were cultivators. So the young person handed a jade strip[^1] to Lin Xuan.

Lin Xuan was somewhat surprised, but seeing that everyone around him also had one, he took it without saying anything.

Moving under a big tree, seeing that there was no one around him, Lin Xuan circulated his spiritual power and injected his spiritual sense onto it. Suddenly, rows upon rows of characters and images appeared in his mind. Of course, these were not techniques, but instead, was the introductions to this treasures trade fair and some important matters.

Lin Xuan took a look and sure enough, there were several techniques for sale. Unfortunately, the introductions were not very detailed, but it certain that the Spiritual Control technique was one of them. Lin Xuan was rejoicing in his heart, keeping a calm and collected look on his face, and withdrew his spiritual sense.

Putting the jade strip[^1] into his bosom[^2], Lin Xuan moved into the basin. He first followed the requirements of the jade strip[^1] and went to a stretch of buildings on the east side of the basin.

There were many stand alone cottages which were the guest houses of the Soaring Cloud sect, which were now used to receive foreign cultivators. If they wanted to participate in the treasures trade fair, they must register here.

"Name and sect?"

"Zhao Gang, rogue cultivator."

Lin Xuan was determined to not have his identity exposed and did not hesitate to give a fake name. Obviously, the old man handling the registration would not try to verify his identity. He only reached out his hand and released a misty white light from his fingers to carve "Zhao Gang" onto the front of a medallion, with some other words engraved on the back.

"Okay, this is your transaction token, hold on to it."

Although it was only a casual showing off his power, the old man still made Lin Xuan speechless. He was actually in the early stages of Foundation Building. But like the young usher, he also had dull eyes, because after the trade fair, he also had to cripple his own cultivation and become a mortal.

One Foundation Building cultivator was already this powerful, and the Soaring Cloud sect still had at least a dozen more, and they were still forced to disband. Lin Xuan was very curious as to just how powerful Core Formation cultivators were. Although the patriarch of the Floating Cloud Valley was a Core Formation cultivator, but as a low-level disciple, he only saw him from afar when entering the sect. Usually the patriarch, Immortal Yun He, was in seclusion, and even when he came out, Lin Xuan would not be qualified to see him again.

He was somewhat moved in his heart but only showed an indifferent look. Lin Xuan took the medallion and went to look at his room. Although it cannot be said to be luxurious, it was still spacious and comfortable. It was especially wonderful because there was a layer of restriction around the house that would only allow the holder of the medallion through. This would not only let the cultivator sleep and rest, but also allow them to safely cultivate in peace.

After looking around the room, Lin Xuan dragged over a prayer mat and sat down cross-legged. He was not practising cultivation, instead, he was restoring his spiritual power. Although he did not hurry on his two-day journey, but the continuous usage of the Imperial Wind technique still consumed a lot of spiritual power.

After meditating for around two hours, he fully recovered his spiritual power. Lin Xuan then went to sleep. Since there was still some time to the treasures trade fair, first he would restore his body to it's best condition. And anyway, it was already evening and could be considered to be going to sleep a little early.
