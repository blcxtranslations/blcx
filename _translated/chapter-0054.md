Even better, because spiritual power needed to be poured into the globe, he could control how much he poured into it and as a result how much cultivation he wanted to hide. If he poured more into it, then there would be less spiritual power left in his meridians and dantian and this his cultivation would appear lower.

Lin Xuan tested it out and discovered that the most he could hide was ninety percent of his spiritual power. Thus, if someone probed his cultivation, they would mistake him for a cultivator at the first layer of the Spirit Gathering stage.

But no matter how hard Lin Xuan tried, he could not hide all the spiritual power is his body. One cannot be too greedy, Lin Xuan was already satisfied with this kind of result.

Laying on the bed, Lin Xuan started to think about the benefits that the green liquid purified from the Red Silk grass gave him. Firstly, it gave him the ability to hide his cultivation from his peers and had solved all of his worries. He no longer needed to think about the consequences of having his cultivation exposed.

Secondly, it could also give him the advantage in battle. The only reason was this: it would let the opponent underestimate him. The globe would hide his cultivation but does not obstruct his ability to use techniques. The opponent would think that he is a cultivator in the first layer and might not even use a spirit shield when fighting against him. Then he would be able to take advantage of their unpreparedness and suddenly launch a sneak attack by using a powerful technique

Of course, he still had some questions that he needed to answer first. The effect of the green liquid must have a time limit after which the globe it generated will vanish. He decided to slowly experiment with this.

Actually, it wasn't just about the Red Silk grass. This experiment had a greater meaning. It demonstrated that the blue stars could not only raise the effects of medicinal pills but used on plants, it also had a purifying effect. This got Lin Xuan very excited.

It had so many benefits. It gave Lin Xuan even more confidence in his journey of cultivation!

Lin Xuan rested for a while to allow the star ocean to recover, then he started to purify again. Once he had grasped the skill, purifying Red Silk grass was much easier than purifying pills.

After spending the whole night, Lin Xuan was able to purify that entire basket of Red Silk grass and filled three jade bottles with essences. Because he only needed a sip of it to form the cultivation hiding globe, these three bottles would therefore last for a long time.

With nothing else to worry about, Lin Xuan focused on his cultivation. He was not at all satisfied with reaching the latter layers of the Spirit Gathering stage. He was only entered into the fifth layer, now it was time to head for an even higher layer.

It really was not because Lin Xuan was impatient, but this trip taught him that to cultivators, might makes right. He was still too weak, so he must increase his efforts in cultivating.

Not to mention other things, the goal of this entire trip to the Soaring Cloud sect was to acquire the Spiritual Control technique. But only after he had gotten the mid-grade cultivation technique did he find that it was different from what he had imagined.

If he wanted to learn the Spiritual Control technique, he would at least need the strength of the eighth layer!

This was because using the Spiritual Control technique would use up spiritual power really fast. If one's cultivation was weak, one would not be able to support that kind of usage of spiritual power. Therefore, the minimum of the sixth layer was required.

Lin Xuan was not disheartened at all. Increasing his power first was also good. If his foundation was solid, the amount of power he was able to display with spirit tools would also be greater.

Following this, Lin Xuan spent half a month purifying pills. After entering the latter layers of the Spirit Gathering stage, the volume of the start ocean had increased greatly and with it, the success rate of purifying also went up. Therefore, although he had spent the same amount of time as last time, but he was able to purify many more pills than last time. In particular, he was able to purify over sixty mid-grade pills this time. Therefore, following his plan of entering seclusion for a month, he would be able to take two to three mid-grade pills a day.

A month later, Lin Xuan left seclusion. He did not have any expressions on his face. Without saying a word, he went to the warehouse storing the waste pills and took a batch. Then he returned to his house and once again shut the doors.

......

Another month passed. Lin Xuan came out again, and after resting for not even a single day, once again entered seclusion.

Zhao Ming and the rest of the children were endlessly shocked and amazed and were almost prostrating themselves in admiration. He was able to sleep in for months at a time and not get bored of it, other than this immortal in front of them, where else can you find one like him?

They did not have a shred of suspicion. The was because of Lin Xuan's shrewdness. He act of being lazy had already been deeply imprinted in their minds, so he was able to fool all of them.

Just like this, he had already spent three months before he formally concluded his seclusion.

No pain, no gain. With countless pills and his own efforts, he had finally cultivated to the sixth layer.

Thinking back on these three months, even with Lin Xuan's awesome willpower, he still felt some trepidation. He almost never rested or slept. Every day, he would get less than two hours of sleep. And if he was not doing sitting meditation, then he was cultivating.

The circulation of vital energy of the Soaring Cloud technique consumed a lot of energy to practice. In the beginning, completing one cycle would exhaust him to the point where even moving a single finger was difficult. Yet he did not rest and clenched his teeth and continued on. Now, he could do nine complete cycles every day.

To make such rapid progress in cultivation was all due to the support of the medicinal power of pills. Lin Xuan's own sacrifices were also a big reason for his progress.

However, this breakthrough was not like last time. Last time when he had just broken through to the fifth layer, his body had emitted a faint layer of spiritual power. With one look, one would be able to tell that that person had an extraordinary cultivation. But now, he did not look out of the ordinary at all, in fact, he looked very listless and washed out.

Of course, this was not because Lin Xuan was too tired from cultivating. Although these few months have been very trying, but he had already had a good night's sleep before coming out and his body and spiritual power had already recovered to their optimal conditions.

He purposely acted listless and had also consumed some of the green liquid that was purified from the Red Silk grass. Not to mention some ordinary elders, even if he was standing in front of the patriarch, immortal Yun He, a Core Formation expert, Lin Xuan believed that he would also not be able to see through his fake cultivation of the first layer.

"Immortal!" See Lin Xuan finally coming out of the house, Zhao Ming and the children hurriedly saluted him.

"Alright, you guys can go back to your tasks, don't worry about me."

Lin Xuan headed out and left the courtyard. Although he had already reached the sixth layer and can now learn the Spiritual Control technique, but he had been shut in the house for a long time and wanted to go out for a stroll. Even though he work very hard when cultivating, he understood that there needed to be a balance between work and rest. Haste will ruin everything, it was best to rest for a few days.
