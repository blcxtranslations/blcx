Thus, in the next period of time, Lin Xuan concentrated on purifying pills and purified over one hundred low-grade and two mid-grade pills.

In particular, the purification of the low-grade pills were very successful, but the speed of the mid-grade pills were slower. He had also reached a bottleneck in the circulation of the star ocean. If he wanted to break through, he would need to raise his cultivation but one layer because the capabilities of the star ocean was directly related the the level of cultivation.

The reason Lin Xuan purified so many pills at once was because he was planning to do some closed door cultivation for a little while. This time, he would stop at nothing to enter into the latter layers of the Spirit Gathering stage, and achieve the fifth layer.

Setting his goal, he strived to accomplished it. At present, all the preparations have been completed.

Yet in the short amount of time that Lin Xuan spent purifying pills, there as a feeling of an impending storm in the cultivation world of the Yan prefecture of Zhao country. There was civil unrest, the cultivator clans were in continuous conflict, and even though the sects had not taken any actions, they were also having lots of verbal arguments. The rogue cultivators were all very fearful for their lives.

The fuse was the disbanding of the Soaring Cloud sect. The Soaring Cloud sect had offended a Core Formation expert and were forced to disband. The other sects didn't say anything, but they took joy in other's misfortunes. There were also many benefits to the Soaring Cloud sect being disbanded. Firstly, the various sects would be able to divide the territory of the Soaring Cloud sect.

Secondly, at the trades fair, they were able to acquire quite a lot of treasures. Although the Soaring Cloud sect was small, but it still had over a thousand years of heritage. The wealth they had accumulated was not small.

Originally, this was a joyous occasion, but who would have though that after the trades fair, there would be a string of accidents. First the famous cultivation clan, the Wang family, their disciples that they had sent out were attacked and killed and the treasures and cultivation technique they had purchased had been stolen.

Yan Tian Heng thought that he was an old fox, but he was still not meticulous enough. He was slightly negligent and left some tiny hints. The Wang family could be considered the number of cultivator clan in the thousands of kilometres of the surrounding area. When have they ever suffered this kind of misfortune? They were very angry and three Foundation Building elders even went to the Yan family demanding that they pay with their lives.

There wasn't really anything out of the ordinary about this. The Wang family was strong, the Yan family was weak, and besides, Yan Tian Heng killed and plundered their people and treasures. Although the cultivation world was ruled by might, but the various clans would still give each other some face. However, Yan Tian Heng's actions were overly excessive so there was no room for redemption.

The Wang family elders originally wanted Yan Tian Heng to pay with his life, but when they got there, they found that the Yan patriarch and his son had disappeared without a trace. There were only elders, children, women, infants, and some low-level cultivators there.

Lin Xuan's actions were truly airtight. No one knew that the father and son of the Yan family were already sleeping in that nameless forest. The Wang family elders had thought that once the father and son knew that they were exposed, they had forsaken their family and had fled.

One of the elders had a fiery temper and could not control his anger after that. He wanted to kill every single person of the Yan family right there, but in the end the other two elders were able to talk him down. Of course, they were not doing this to because they were kind hearted nor did they refrain from killing because they could not bear to take action. They stopped him because they did not want to cause such a disturbance before clearly understanding the situation.

Although the Yan family was only a mid-level cultivator clan, they had a deep relationship with the Flame Spirit sect, just like how their Wang family had a good relationship with the Floating Cloud Valley.

要知道在修真界，门派才是最大的势力，各修真家族，除非真有不得了的高手，要不然都会选择依附一个门派。

至于依附谁，各家族选择的也不同，有的是在同一地域，较近的，可以更好照拂，有的祖上根本就是那本派的弟子，有的则通过联姻的方式，不一而足……

燕天衡理亏在先，杀人抢宝不留情面，要他抵命，火灵门也无话可说，毕竟他们如果不讲道理，汪家背后的飘云谷也会介入，可现在燕天衡父子失踪，灭燕家满门泄愤，火灵门肯定不会袖手，这样，从道理上来说，就是汪家不对了。

虽然修真界是以拳头说话，但那是在双方实力相差很大的情况下，假如双方差不多，又都不想两败俱伤，那么就要“讲道理”了。

于是，汪家长老丢下狠话，飘然离去，但也并没有走远，而是兵分两路，一人回去报信，并调集弟子搜索燕天衡，另两人则守株待兔，在燕家附近监视。

听说家主闯了大祸，燕家的人也是呆若木鸡，大惊失色，起初还以为有什么误会，想等燕天衡回来解释清楚，可随着时间的流逝，燕家父子却踪影全无，于是他们从彷徨到疑惑，以为家主遭了汪家长老的毒手，对方为了掩盖真相，反过来冤枉家主杀了他们的人，还上门问罪。

燕家当然不服气了，便像火灵门求助。

火灵门，顾名思义，擅长火属性的功法，论实力，在兖州的宗派之中，排第二，与飘云谷相比，仅差了一点点。

他们的掌门虽然是筑基期，但同样有一位凝丹期的前辈长老，而那个长老，法力虽高，品行却很好色，而燕天衡的二女儿，正是那长老喜欢的小妾之一。

有了这层关系，加上火灵门与飘云谷一直争夺兖州修真界霸主的地位，本就有嫌隙，只不过互相顾忌，平时将不满压了下来。

现在，燕家和汪家各执一词，一边是数个弟子被袭杀，宝物与功法也被抢走，令一边则说家主遇害，对方却反咬一口，总之两个修真家族的恩怨，将飘云谷与火灵门两大宗派也牵扯了进来。

而这两大巨头一动，兖州的其他门派自然不可能独善其身了，有的与火灵门交好，有的与飘云谷有旧，形成了两大对峙的联盟。

好在吵归吵，闹归闹，各大门派的首脑不傻，一旦冲突燃起，肯定是两败俱伤，所以现在还仅限于打口水仗。

然而火yao味儿已经很浓，散修们风声鹤唳，生怕一不小心，就被卷入其中，大祸临头。

而其他的修真家族，当然也是帮各自依附的门派说话，吵得沸沸扬扬，他们不像门派有那么多顾忌，平时就有仇的更是趁机报复，这几天，已陆续有修真家族火并动手。

总之一句话，事情是越闹越大。
