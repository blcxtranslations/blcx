The treasures trade fair would be held nine days from now and the place is the location of the Soaring Cloud sect, Sky Pillar mountan. After getting this information, Lin Xuan continued to chat some more with these two, then casually left.

The whole time, he had a very casual expression on his face. No matter how you looked at it, it just seemed to be a strong curiosity and did not have any hidden meanings. And until finally leaving the library, and seeing no one else around, did Lin Xuan finally should a delighted smile on his lips.

He finally found the whereabouts of the Spirit Control technique!

There were two ways to enter the second level of the library. Either he didn't satisfy it, or he would arouse suspicion, so both were not desirable. But the treasures trade fair, there would definitely be mid rank techniques for sale. As an outsider,
买完就怕拍屁股走路，
and about other troubles.

The sound of footsteps came from behind and Lin Xuan's smile disappeared. Revealing a very normal expression, closely passing the approaching person, he no longer delayed and directly went back to the courtyard of the Waste Pills storage.

Since he made the decision to participate and acquire the Spirit Control technique in the trade fair, the following that, Lin Xuan started to prepare for the trip. He had already as and figured out clearly, Sky Pillar mountain was around four hundred kilometres away. To mortals, it can be said to be a little far, but Lin Xuan was a cultivator, and even though he could not fly on his spirit tools, he still knew the Imperial Wind technique and could cover the distance quickly. Four hundred kilometres would take one day while hurrying and two if he took it slow. He could reach it either way, so that gave him seven days time to prepare.

This kind of sect disbanding trade fair was different from the regular trade fairs of the cultivator cities. These did not use spirit stones, but pills, as money. To Lin Xuan, the was great news, even though he acquired Zhou Yan and Zhang Yu's wealth, he only had dozens of low grade spirit stones.
但晶石除了交易，
以后练功，
制器都有用，
轻易林轩可舍不得。

Moveover, Lin Xuan had special circumstances, the only thing he had no shortage of was pills. So to him, using pills as currency was the the best. Of course, the concept of "when you go out to buy, don't show your silver" was very clear to Lin Xuan, he was only a low level Spirit Gathering cultivator, it he seemed like he had deep pockets, it was easily to bring disaster on himself. He could not like the people of the Soaring Cloud sect, who had the protection of the commandment.

所以此行，
准备既要充分，
带上足够多的丹药，
So for this trip, to be fully prepare, he needed to bring enough pills, and he also needed to be cautious. If it wasn't a good opportunity, he would not easily act. All in all, he needed to be careful and not attract attention.

After making this plan, Lin Xuan started putting it in action.

The primary task for these few days was to purify a lot of pills. Cultivation practice can be temporarily slowed. After all, there are priorities, and things did not need to be that rigid, one needed to learn to be flexible based on different situations.

After these last few months, as to the usage of the star ocean to purify Purified Essence pills, Lin Xuan could do with ease.
他待在屋里，
昼夜奋战。

When the immortal coming back and shutting himself indoors, the children led by Zhao Ming were not suspicious at all. They simply that the steward was busy being lazy and sleeping again.

Five days passed like this. Lin Xuan got up off the ground, and stretched his stiff body. These few days and nights of purifying was really tiring, but the haul was considerable. In total, he had three bottles, which was equal to three hundred low grade pills, and nine mid grade pills.

从数量上来说，
已经十分骇人，
林轩之所以提纯那么多，
也是为了有备无患，
毕竟在修真界的各种灵丹妙药，
灵动期才用的洗髓丹属于最低级，
最垃圾的一种，
当作交易的货币，
究竟有多大的价值，
林轩心也没有底，
所以为了以防万一，
还是多带一点在身上保险。

他可不希望出现想买功法却丹药不够的情况！

丹药提纯好了，
林轩准备出发，
首先他先清理了一下自己的家当，
晶石二十八颗，
灵器三件，
除此以外，
还有金木水火土等五行符箓数十张。

这些与提纯出来的丹药一起，
都要随身携带，
一来放心安全，
二来这次出行，
天知道会不会遇见危险，
有了这些装备，
自己的实力也更强。

虽然东西不少，
但林轩从周燕和张羽那里得到了一个储物手镯，
一条储物腰带，
装进去就行了，
十分的方便。

除此以外，
林轩还将从张羽那儿得到的一件背心贴身穿在了身上，
虽然不知道此物是用什么织就而成，
但十分坚韧，
一看就是防御的宝物，
这样的好东西，
当然不能够荒置浪费了。

做好这一切之后，
林轩就出了门，
当然，
首先要到门派管理众弟的地方通知一声，
也就是取得外出的资格。

如果是筑基期的修真者还要备案，
不过像他们这样灵动期的弟就简单多了，
门派根本不重视，
随便想个理由，
就能轻松唬弄过去。

取得外出的腰牌以后，
林轩就离开了飘云谷，
这是他入谷近四年来，
第一次出远门，
心也颇为感慨。

其实时间还早，
四天后交易会才开张，
不过早去有早去的好处，
毕竟是陌生的地方，
先熟悉熟悉环境，
了解一下各种东西的行情，
做到心有数，
这样自己此行才更安全也更圆满，
这也是林轩的性格，
做事情不喜欢冒失，
习惯于谋定而后动。

两天后。

天柱山位于赵国兖州东部，
绵延数十里，
植被繁茂，
郁郁葱葱，
其主峰天柱峰更是以险峻雄奇闻名于世，
高五千多米，
山上多嶙峋怪石，
据说连猴也翻不过去。

古往今来，
也有不少人来这儿游览，
无奈到处悬崖绝壁，
遍寻整座山峰，
也找不到一条入山的道路，
只能望峰兴叹。

渐渐的，
来这儿的人也日渐稀少了起来。

然而这天，
天柱峰下却来了一个不到二十的少年，
相貌平凡，
穿着一身粗布衣服，
这也是林轩故意为之，
这次自己是悄悄出来收购功法，
当然要尽量不引人注意，
穿着飘云谷弟的服饰既碍眼，
又容易暴露，
所以他特意换成了普通散修的衣服，
加上本来就平凡的样貌，
只要自己往人堆里一钻，
就谁也认不出来。
