"Mid rank techniques for Foundation Building cultivators?"

Hearing these words, Lin Xuan was suddenly stunned. He looked at the two that were talking. They were both strangers to him. Even though Floating Cloud Valley was only a small, third rate sect, but they still had over a thousand disciples. Lin Xuan, other than being slightly familiar with the others who entered the sect at the same time, did not know most of the other disciples. But from their clothing, it could be seen that they are also two low levelled Spirit Gathering disciples.

They just mentioned some Soaring Cloud sect getting disbanded, and mid rank techniques. Lin Xuan caught up, greeting aloud: "Fellow disciples."

"You are......" The two stopped walking and looked at the young man blocking the road with uncertainty.

"I am called Zhao Gang, I salute you." Lin Xuan's attitude was very friendly, with a harmless on his face, because he wanted to find out some information from them.

At the same time, he released his spiritual power, allowing those two to see that he was at the fourth layer of the Spirit Gathering stage. The reason he was being this bold was because they have never met before, and they did not know that he had no spiritual roots. The cultivation world followed the law of the jungle, 非常势力. If one did not have enough strength, they would not be taken seriously, not to mention inquiring about the current situation.

But Lin Xuan did not play all of his cards, he didn't give them his real name, he just casually made one up.

These two were also at the Spirit Gathering stage, their cultivation levels were just slightly below Lin Xuan's. Seeing this more powerful cultivator offering such a friendly greeting, they did not dare ignore him, and quick and laughingly replied: "No, no, so it's brother Zhao, I wonder if there is anything senior brother wanted?"

"Senior brother?" Hearing these two calling him that, he secretly laughed. These two were clearly past their thirties, and most likely entered the sect before him, but insisted on treating themselves as the juniors. This would be unthinkable in the past. Lin Xuan once again experienced the superiority of having high spiritual power. It really felt good.

Looking calm, Lin Xuan smiled and asked: "The two brothers are too polite, what should I address you by?"

"I am Li Hai, and this is junior fellow apprentice Chen Feng Chen"

"Okay, let us go sit!"

"Okay." The two nodded their agreement. This was not because they were easygoing and were nice and caring of others. But it was because Lin Xuan deliberately released his spiritual power just now, revealing the power of the fourth layer, putting hesitation in their hearts.

This junior fellow apprentice, who was called Zhao Gang, who didn't look to be over twenty, was already at the peak of the fourth layer, only one step away from the latter Spirit Gathering stages. He must be a genius disciple with excellent spiritual roots. This is what these two thought.

Geniuses like this, were not only the focuses of the sect elders, but also had a great chance of successfully building their Foundation, becoming an even higher levelled cultivator.

That is to say, in the eyes of these two, Lin Xuan had an immeasurable future. These kind of people could not be given the cold shoulder.

人心隔肚皮，
不过以林轩的聪明，
也将两人的想法猜了个 ba jiu 不离十，
心暗暗好笑，
也深切感受到蓝色星海带来的变化，
如果不是可以将废丹提纯，
有了大量灵药做为支撑，
自己怎么可能被误认为是天才。

The three of them sat down in a secluded corner and exchanged some pleasantries. But Li Hai ran out of patience and asked: "Brother Zhao, you stopped us, I do not know if you have anything to advise us about?"

"Haha, it's nothing much, I just heard the two brothers discussing something about the Soaring Cloud sect disbanding and was curious about it."
"So it was about that!" Li was relieved. He adopted a relaxed and somewhat proud expression and said: "I don't dare say anything else, but in terms of being well informed, this junior is one of the best in the sect. The news of this situation hasn't been spread it, so it was no wonder that senior brother did not know."

"Haha, I just wanted to ask about that."

一般说来，
实力强大的修真者面对修为比自己低的修士时都是一副扯高气昂的模样，
林轩平易近人的态度让厉海很受用，
当下，
知无不言言无不尽，
将整件事情的经过，
详细的讲了出来。

修真界宗门万千，
以飘云谷来说，
实力算是等偏下，
上千修士之，
百分之十都是灵动期的低阶弟，
但也有近百人的筑基期修士，
做为护法长老，
同时掌门云鹤真人，
还是一位进入了凝丹初期的大高手。

这样的实力，
当然说不上强，
但也不容轻辱，
毕竟掌门凝丹期的修为已经非常厉害，
近百筑基期修士也让人胆寒，
在这一片地域，
称霸扩张说不上，
但自保不受排挤欺负还是没有问题。

当然，
在这方圆数千里之内，
不可能只有飘云谷一个修真门派，
散修暂且不谈，
小门派林林种种的还有七八个，
其凌云门就是其之一了。

如果说飘云谷的实力在整个修真界来说算三流，
那么凌云门就是四流或者五流了，
他的门人倒也不少，
和飘云谷一样也有上千，
然而筑基期的修士才十几个，
凝丹期的高手更是想也别想，
便是掌门，
也才筑基期的修为而已。

一个门派，
高级修士才是力量的间，
灵动期的低阶弟再多，
在争斗也没有什么作用，
所以尽管凌云门修真者的人数也不少，
实力却远远无法与飘云谷相比。

可就是这么一个小门派，
在前不久，
却得罪了一位凝丹期的大高手，
事情具体的经过，
除了当事者，
其他人也并不清楚，
但有一点是肯定的，
那位凝丹期的高手非常恼怒，
放话说一个月之内，
要将凌云门杀得鸡犬不留。

修真境界每提升一个层次，
实力是完全不一样的，
可以说质的飞跃，
面对凝丹期的敌人，
灵动期低阶弟再多也没用，
做炮灰都没有资格，
而仅仅靠十几个筑基期修士，
无异于螳臂当车。

所以对凌云门来说，
这次简直是大祸临头。

像他们这样的小门派，
肯定也无法找到强有力的援手，
在经过一系列努力，
并千般斟酌后，
凌云门终于做出了一个痛苦而无奈的选择，
解散，
这也是他们唯一一条可以躲过血光之灾的活路。
