"You can slowly contemplate this question when you arrive in the underworld!"

Lin Xuan displayed a cold smile on his lips. Forming a strange hand-seal with his fingers, he filled the flying sword with his spiritual power.

"Whoosh!"

Like a ray of light or a bolt of lightning, the flying sword whistled towards Ye Tian. Ye Tian expression turned ugly instantly and he hurriedly poured his spiritual power into the streamer. But it was completely useless. Although the shield created by the streamer was extremely stable, but when faced with the power of a high-grade spirit artifact, it was simply like tofu. With an ear-piercing whoosh, the shield was ripped apart, and a bloody hole appeared on Ye Tian's chest. With a face full of unwillingness, Ye Tian started to fall.

With a wave of his hand, the spirit artifact returned to his hand and shrank down into a small model sword of approximately one inch. As well, the giant skeleton that was tangled in battle with the demonic tiger, after losing the support of Ye Tian's spiritual power, dispersed into individual malicious spirits and returned into the streamer.

As for that low-grade fire snake, it started to fall out of the sky as well. Lin Xuan threw out a technique and collected it up with his golden rope.

The beast seal also returned to normal, but it was different from before. Its spiritual power had decreased significantly. It looks like after this battle, there was not much of the demonic tiger soul left in the seal.

Lin Xuan felt pained by that, but at least he got ample spoils this time. He moved to Ye Tian's corpse and picked up the demonic streamer and from Ye Tian's bosom retrieved a storage bag.

It was not wise to stay there, so after collecting all the treasures, Lin Xuan threw out a low-rank quicksand seal and buried Ye Tian's body below the ground. After that, he erased the bloodstains in the area and then quickly returned to the Floating Cloud Valley.

Without stopping at all, he quickly returned to waste pills storage of Danxia mountain and arrived at his own residence.

Closing the door, Lin Xuan finally exhaled and laid down on his bed. This battle had been very dangerous, much more dangerous than when he fought with the Yan family patriarch. Demonic cultivators were all strange and vicious and Ye Tian also had a lot of tricks up his sleeves.

But in the end, Lin Xuan was still the victor!

Lin Xuan rested for a while and recovered his physical strength and spiritual power, then he started to examine his spoils. He took out the storage bag and upended it. With a rumbling sound, tens of spirit stones fell out and landed on his table causing Lin Xuan's eyes to shine. With a quick glance, there seemed to be over fifty spirit stones.

Lin Xuan was very happy and at the same time very shocked. Even Zhang Yu did not have such an amount back then. He didn't know if Ye Tian took these by force or if he acquired these by swindling and cheating, but no matter what, these all belong to him now.

Other than these, there were also a couple of mid-rank seals. Although there were not many, but to Lin Xuan, they were still a welcome addition.

Also, in the deepest part of the storage bag, there was a jade slip. But it was different from a regular jade slip. Its surface had a bloody lustre to it and had a heavy Yin aura around it. It looks like this is the jade slip that chronicled the method of demonic cultivation. Lin Xuan was curious and inserted his spiritual sense into it.

After almost an hour, Lin Xuan had finished skimming over the technique. Grasping the jade slip, Lin Xuan stayed silent.

It had to be said that the precursors of the demonic cultivators truly did not lack wisdom and intelligence. They even discovered such an out of the way alternate route to greatly increase the speed of cultivation. In all fairness, Lin Xuan was also moved by it. But soon after, he discarded that idea. It was not because of these good and evil labels that he discarded the idea, but because as the elders have said, although demonic cultivation would allow one to speedily progress in cultivation, but it also left behind glaring vulnerabilities and hidden dangers. Also, because of the speed of cultivation, ones dao-heart would not be stable and their foundations would be shallow. In the future, it would obstruct one's cultivation or even suffer heart-demons with no hope of redemption.

Lin Xuan did not want to see such a tragic end to his road of cultivation. Haste will ruin everything. In any case, he had the ability to purify pills, and as long as he was hardworking, he would still have a great future either way, there was no need to be anxious for quick results.

Although he did not plan to be a demonic cultivator, the jade slip was far from being useless. He did not plan on using the cultivation technique, but there were also many other mysterious techniques contained within it.

These so called techniques were only techniques for circulating spiritual power throughout the body. Not matter if you are a regular cultivator or a demonic cultivator, it would not have any negative effects on your cultivation, body, or techniques.

Lin Xuan glanced through then, there were many different kinds of techniques in the slip. There were all quite useful, so if he had the time in the future, he would definitely practice them.

Putting down the jade slip, Lin Xuan looked towards the other two objects.

The first one was the Hundred Souls Streamer. Lin Xuan had already personally experienced the power of this artifact. It was indeed extraordinary, it was a weapon that could both attack and defend, only it was different than what the jade slip had described.

According to the demonic cultivation technique, this Hundred Souls Streamer could match up to a high-grade spirit artifact. But when he was battling with Ye Tian, it was not that powerful at all.

Otherwise, even if the beast seal could somehow rival it, it was not possible for the seal to defeat the streamer.

After thinking about this, Lin Xuan figured it must be because this demonic artifact had not been completely refined because it could only display a part of its power. But even then, its power still exceed that of a mid-grade spirit artifact and could be considered a good treasured item.

The last item was that low-grade spirit artifact, the fire snake. To ordinary Spirit Condensation disciples, any spirit artifact, even if it was only a low-grade one, they could only hope to see one let alone owning one. But Lin Xuan's situation was special. To someone was wealthy as he was, it was nothing special. When he has the chance in the future, he would use this fire snake to trade for some spirit stones or other precious materials.

So to sum it up. even though this battle had been dangerous, the gains were still good. His only regret was that the energy in the beast seal had been decreased greatly. But this kind of loss, compared to the benefits he had gained, was not even worth mentioning.

After sorting through these treasures and placing them in his storage bracelet, Lin Xuan laid backed down and fell asleep. Although he had recovered his physical strength and spiritual power, but this difficult battle still to a toll on his body.

In the morning of the next day, Lin Xuan started his new method of cultivation.

This time, he did not immediately try to attack the next layer, but instead he prepared to practice the Spiritual Control technique. After experiencing these two battles, Lin Xuan fully realized the utility of these spirit artifacts. However, solely relying on Telekinesis would allow him to only partially utilize the spirit artifact's power. Therefore, he wanted to learn the proper way to use spirit artifacts, the Spiritual Control technique.
