A wild wind blew past, clearing the smoke and dust in the air. It revealed Yan Tian Heng holding a seal. He was channelling all of his spiritual power into it like a dam bursting. Seeing this kind of action, Lin Xuan's expression turned more and more serious. This is definitely not some simple seal.

Lin Xuan was definitely not dumb enough to let his opponent complete their technique and thus prepared to though out an attack. But at that moment, Yan Tian Heng showed a sinister smile on his lips. He threw the seal into the air and yelled out: "Soul, release!"

Roar!

A roar sounded out, reverberating around the surrounding hills and causing many trees to break and fall. The seal released many rays of brilliance and amidst a red light, a flaming fierce tiger appeared.

A fierce flame tiger, no, that wasn't right. Its body was covered by a sharp carapace of bone. This should be an armoured fierce flame tiger, a first class top grade monstrous beast.

For cultivators, their levels from Spirit Gathering to Tribulation Ascension were split into eight stages. Similarly, monstrous beasts also had eight levels with every level being further split into low-grade, mid-grade, high-grade, and top-grade.

Spirit Gathering corresponds to first class monstrous beasts, Foundation Building corresponds to second-class, and so on......

In other words, this monstrous beast was not inferior to an expert at the great perfection of the Spirit Gathering stage.

Lin Xuan had a bitter expression on his face. This was not an illusory technique but was a genuine demon tiger. Or more correctly, the soul of a demon tiger.

He did not expect that they would have a one of these rarely seen beast seals.

These so-called beast seals were like the array seals and belonged to a special category of seals. Regular seals contained attacking, defending, or supporting type techniques.

And array seals contained basic arrays.

But beast seals also had other differences. One was that they sealed beast souls in them. They were even rarer than array seals because they could not be made by regular cultivators and could only be crafted by cultivators following the demonic path.

Simply put, after killing a monstrous beast, they soul must be extracted and using some special methods sealed into the seal papers.

Another difference was that they were not one time use like other seals but could instead be used over and over again. Of course, there were limits. Each time it was used it would consume some of the energy of the beast soul. After all, of the energy was used up, the seal would also no longer function.

Lin Xuan had also read about beast seals in some ancient texts before, but he never imagined that he would have to face one.

Roar!

Although it was only the soul, it still had such a fearsome roar. Of course, after using those special methods to craft the beast seal, the strength of the soul was not inferior to the real beast in the slightest.

"Go!"

Yan Tian Heng made some incantation gestures and lightly tapped the beast causing it to bare its fangs and brandish its claws. It then changed into a ball of red light and charged towards Lin Xuan.

It was a dangerous situation but Lin Xuan did not panic. He activated the seal in his hands and threw it in the air......

Quicksand technique, Rockfall technique, Briers technique, etc. A total of five low-grade techniques activated and yet it only managed to stall the demon tiger slightly. It then continued pouncing towards him.

Lin Xuan's expression turned even more serious. Looks like it's time to use the spirit tool!

He reached into his bosom and took out a perhaps one-foot long rope. Lin Xuan mumbled some words and under the spur of those magical incantations, it suddenly became alive, lengthened many meters and reared up, much like a poisonous snake.

"Bind!"

Following the incantation, the rope flew out while emitting a misty white light. I looked like an enormous python flying to meet the armoured fierce flame tiger and tightly wrapped around it.

Although it was a soul and did not have a corporeal body, but the spirit tool was even more magical and nonetheless still bound it.

"Spirit tool!"

Yan Tian Heng could not hold it in and yelled out with a face full of surprise. But who could blame him? Spirit tools were very rare precious treasures. Although theoretically, a low-levelled fourth layer cultivator could utilize them, but in reality, even some Foundation Building experts did not have them.

Originally, it was already hard for him to imagine that Lin Xuan had so many seals, but he would never have thought that Lin Xuan would even have a spirit tool. The discovery caused him to feel apprehensive in his heart.

Mid-grade pill, countless seals, and spirit tools together, not to mention rogue cultivators, even elite disciples of sects, no...... even Foundation Building expects might not have these.

Just what is this brats identity?

With this kind of wealth, his master must be a big-shot. It couldn't be a Core Formation expert right!?

The more he thought about it, the more fearful Yan Tian Heng became.

But he was still the patriarch of a family so he did not let this mess up his strategies and instead his conviction of killing Lin Xuan became even stronger. If this brat got away and his master came out, he would definitely die a very horrible death. He must kill him here and now no matter what.

It can't be said that Yan Tian Heng was too suspicious. If fact, the treasures that Lin Xuan took out were too shocking. It was easy for someone to let their imaginations run wild with speculations and end up scaring themselves.

Although he wanted to kill Lin Xuan but it was very difficult to actually kill him. His cultivation was a while three layers lower but spirit tools were simply too hard to deal with.

Lin Xuan was very upset, his cultivation was still too low and could only control a mid-grade spirit tool. Otherwise, not to mention the Jade Snow ring that he acquired from Zhang Yu, even the high-grade flying sword of Zhou Yan could be used to easily kill his opponent.

They both wanted to kill the other. One did his utmost to urge his demon tiger to throw off its bindings; the other strived to control his spirit tool to continue to wrap around that beast soul. Once again, they came to a deadlock.

As time passed, Lin Xuan seemed like he was getting more anxious. He was tweaking his ears and scratching his cheek, like a cat on a hot tin roof. Yan Tian Heng coldly smiled. His opponent was young and sure enough, was unable to remain calm. Looks like he would be the winner of this duel.

Another two minutes passed and Lin Xuan once again reached into his bosom causing Yan Tian Heng's expression to change. His opponent still had seals. It was not impossible to use mid-rank techniques while controlling the demon tiger soul, but that kind of usage would consume his spiritual power too fast. If he still had many seals......

But in the next moment, his face changed once again into a sinister smile because when Lin Xuan withdrew his hand, it was empty now he looked as if he was losing his head out of fear.

Even heaven is helping me. this brat has run out of seals!
