"Immortal!" Zhao Ming respectfully saluted.

"En." Lin Xuan nodded. Wearing a casual expression, he asked "Recently, what is the situation at the waste pills storage?"

"Rest assured, everything is normal."

Four months after becoming the steward of the waste pills storage, Lin Xuan finally came back to inspect his territory. Even though the juniors lead by Zhao Ming were surprised, they still carefully and respectfully waited on him.

In order to make it more convenient to cultivate, Lin Xuan erected a loves to sleep, lazy, eccentric, and reclusive image for them.

Originally, the intention was to allow him self to cultivate in peace and not arouse suspicions,
但无心插柳，
this fake image instead received these juniors support.

The only reason was because to those lofty high levelled cultivators, mortals are like ants. Therefore, in Floating Cloud Valley, theses juniors held very low status, to put it nicely, they are outer sect disciples, to put it harshly, they are just slaves and menial labourers who serve the cultivators. If they make the smallest mistake, they might get scolded or beat, or they might lose their lives. This is very common and no one would concern themselves or interfere.

These juniors lives, are like walking on thin ice and trembling in fear every day. If they were fortunate, they might have a kind cultivator as their immediate higher-up. If they had a moodier guy for a boss, it was simply......

拿丹霞山负责各处杂务的地方来说，
修真者最不愿意来担管事的地方，
就是废丹房，
因为没有油水，
但与之相反，
童们却最向往，
Because for a long time now, there has not be a cultivator acting as a steward. The temporary steward was also an outer sect disciple like the rest of them. So they lived a very safe and leisurely life.

When Lin Xuan first arrived, Zhao Ming and the rest did not say anything, and did not dare to show anything on their faces. But in their hearts, they were reluctant in every possible way, because they though their happy days were coming to an end.

This the situation was different from what they imagined. Even though Lin Xuan came, but it hard to even catch sight of him. This immortal's character was very eccentric and he loved shutting himself in his house.

In other words, Lin Xuan's arrival, did not cause the slightest change in their lives. Many months have passed, not a single person has been punished. Of course, this was provided that they did not violate the immortal's rules, which was to stay away from his house.

Such a good steward, an easy to serve immortal, was very hard to come by even in a thousand years. Zhao Ming and the rest supported him from the bottom of their hearts and hoped that he would stay the steward of the waste pills storage forever. Because as long as he was here, the sect would not send another cultivator as a steward.

After inspecting the waste pills storage, and chatting about some innocuous things, Lin Xuan asked the juniors to carefully perform their duties, then left to relieve some boredom and get some fresh air.

“恭送仙师！”

Zhao Ming and the rest were not suspicious. Although the steward was lazy and did not like to move, going out for a little was normal, no one would like to stay in their houses forever.

After leaving the crowds gaze and arriving at a deserted place, Lin Xuan's aura of laziness disappeared without a trace, and he now looked smart and mature. Showing a slight trace of a smile on the corner of his mouth, he walked off.

These days, Lin Xuan was thinking a lot. He considered a variety of different methods, but he still could not come up with a method to not arouse suspicions while learning the Spiritual Control skill. It really seemed like there was no method with the best of both worlds.

Fantasizing will not solve the problem, and stuffily sitting there would cause a headache. It's better to go for a walk and play it by ear, maybe there would be a turnaround in the situation.

After leaving DanXia mountain, his temperament changed yet again. He now seed normal and ordinary. He first took a walk around the sect, and have no spoils, he headed to the library.

As a low levelled Spirit Gathering disciple, he could only freely use the first floor. Despite knowing that there were no techniques and there there was only knowledge that would be valuable to ordinary people, which cultivators held no interest in, Lin Xuan still held some minuscule hope, and carefully looked through the first floor again.

Nothing!

After being silent for a while, Lin Xuan grit his teeth and walked towards the second floor.

与凡间的建筑不同，
第一层与第二层之间没有楼梯，
不能够飞上去，
The layout is different from building in the secular world. The first and second floors were not connected by stairs,
还布有重重禁制，
one could not fly up to the second level, and could only rely on the teleportation array to enter or leave.

Lin Xuan only took a few steps, but air in front of him started fluctuating like water ripples, and a layer of yellow coloured shield, like a wall, blocked him way forward.

This is a restriction, to reach the teleportation array, one must first break through the shield, which is also a test. Because according to the design of the sect, to break this restriction, one needed to be at least at the Foundation Building stage. This also guaranteed that those who entered the second floor were not low levelled disciples. Of course, that was excluding applying to the patriarch for permission to enter.

Looking at the yellow light before him, Lin Xuan came to a stop and silently observed. Although according to common sense, this restriction could only be broken by those with the minimum cultivation of Foundation Building, but he still had a good chance of breaking through.

Firstly, he grasped the Ice Needles spell, which was comparable to high rank techniques in power. Secondly, he also had extraordinarily powerful spirit tools. As long as he puts all of his power into it, excluding everything else, in attack power at least, Lin Xuan was confident that he would be no less powerful than a cultivator with no spirit tools who just stepped into the Foundation Building stage.

But Lin Xuan did not act, and instead, he hesitated, then pretended that nothing happened and walked away. Whether it was Ice Needles or spirit tools, they would both shock others, and Lin Xuan did not want that kind of attention.

And even if he broke through this restriction, and arrived at the second floor via the teleportation array, it was guaranteed that there are restrictions on the books there.

Although he wanted to learn the Spiritual Control technique, but weighing the pros and cons, he couldn't expose his strength, therefore, he chose to not act rashly.

Looks like he has to think of something else. After making this decision, Lin Xuan turn around and headed outside. But at that moment, the sound of conversation drifted by.

"I heard that the Soaring Cloud sect was forced to disband."

"Hmph, it's their fault that they offended a Core Formation senior export. Unless they all want to die, they can only disband their sect."

A cultivator up ahead nodded, and regretfully said: "Although the Soaring Cloud sect cannot compare to our Floating Cloud Valley, but they are still a sect with almost a thousand years of heritage, they must have a lot of techniques, spirit tools, and seals."

"Yes, I heard there are also a lot of Foundation Building mid rank techniques for sale."
