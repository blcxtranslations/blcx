但不管怎么说，
总是自己的骨肉，
燕天衡一手将儿子拉到身后，
另一只手横于胸前，
法诀变幻，
淡黄色的灵力，
从他的身体表面逸散出来，
形成了一个护盾的模样。
But not matter what, he was still his son. So Yan Tian Heng used one hand to pull his son behind him and raised the other in front of him. A light yellow coloured spirit power flowed from his body and changed into a spiritual shield.

噗！
Pop!

火球与灵力护盾相撞，
嗤嗤作响，
但片刻后，
却如同泥牛入海，
消失不见，
火焰符封印的仅仅是低阶法术，
想要攻破燕家家族的防御，
实在太勉强。
Popping sounds rang out as the fireballs collided with the spiritual shield. But immediately after, the fireballs disappeared. The blaze seal only contained a low-level technique. To want to break through the defense of the Yan family would take a lot more effort.

招数没有起到效果，
林轩的表情越发严肃，
他没有再急着进攻，
这时候仓储出手也没有用。
Seeing that his moves did not have any effect, Lin Xuan become increasingly more serious. He did not quickly continue his assault, to use techniques without knowing the others weaknesses would be useless.

未学打人，
先学挨打，
修真者间的争斗十分凶险，
一不留神就有可能丢掉性命，
所以应该先布下防御，
偷袭既然没有起到效果，
那么接下来林轩就要为持久战做准备了。
To want to beat someone else, one first must learn how to be beaten. The battles between cultivators were very dangerous, one split second of inattention could cause one to lose their life, so one should first lay down their defenses. Seeing that his ambush had failed, Lin Xuan started to prepare for a prolonged battle.

他可不是燕鸣那种废物，
尽管面对强敌，
可林轩依然冷静的思索。
He was trash like that Yan Ming. Even if he was facing a strong foe, he was still able to calmly ponder his actions.

林轩不再犹豫，
调动体内的灵力，
同样在体表形成了一个护罩，
然后从怀里掏出两张符箓，
林轩眼中微微闪过一丝不舍，
但下一刻，
眼神就变得坚决起来了，
将两张符往空中一抛。
Lin Xuan did not hesitate. Circulating his spiritual power, he also formed a protective cover over his body. Then reaching into his bosom, he pulled out two seals. A wistful look flashed in his eyes, but immediately after, he became resolute and threw them into the air.

第一张符金光大放，
化为了一面金色的巨大铜钱出现在林轩的上方，
林轩手一指，
那铜钱就飞了下来，
挡在他的前面。
The first seal flashed brightly and changed into a humongous copper coin about Lin Xuan. He pointed his finger causing the copper coin to descend in front of him, shielding him from the front.

“金刚术！”
"Adamantine technique!"

燕家家族勃然变色，
这可是金属性的中阶防御法术，
非常坚固，
一个散修，
怎么会有这么珍贵的符箓？
The Yan family became agitated. This was a gold type mid-rank defensive technique and was very sturdy. How could a rogue cultivator have such a precious seal?

但他的惊讶才刚刚开始，
另一张符也发挥作用了，
化为了一个淡蓝色的巨大水泡样的东西，
将林轩包裹在里面。
But just as he shouted out, the other seal also activated. It changed into a light blue coloured giant water bubble and wrapped around Lin Xuan.

“水灵符！”
"Water Spirit seal!"

同样是中阶的防御性法术！
This was also a mid-grade defensive technique!

原本听儿子说有散修用中品丹收购功法，
虽然有众多的旁观者为证，
可燕天衡心里一直有些将信将疑，
但现在，
他相信了，
真有人这么做，
凭着多年看人的经验，
这小子绝不是什么散修，
那身打扮，
不过是为了掩人耳目。
When he originally heard from his son about the rogue cultivator that used a mid-grade pill to purchase a cultivation technique, even though there were many witnesses around to confirm it, he still was skeptical in his heart. But now he believed that there really was someone that did that. Using his experience of reading people, this youth in front of him wasn't a rogue cultivator. That kind of outfit was definitely used to try to fool other people.

“你究竟是什么人？”燕天衡脸色发黑，
一字一顿。
"Just who exactly are you?" Yan Tian Heng stressed each syllable and had a sinister face.

林轩没有说话，
事情发展到现在，
双方已是不死不休之局，
多说无益，
傻瓜才会暴露自己的身份。
Lin Xuan did not say anything. Since things were already like this, it could only end with one side or the other dying. There was no point in saying anything, only idiots would expose their own identities.

一下子用掉了两个防御性的中阶法术，
他也很肉疼，
要知道对符箓来说，
防御性的远比攻击的更难制作，
也更珍贵。
It was as if it had cost him an arm and a leg to use those two mid-grade defensive seals. It must be known that defensive seals were much harder than offensive seals to craft and therefore was much more precious.

即便继承了张羽和周燕的身家，
里面也仅有这两个，
而现在一下子就用掉了。
Even though he had inherited these from Zhang Yu and Zhou Yan, there were only these two and he had just used them up.

林轩没有回答，
而是催动灵力，
数个冰弹出现在了空气里，
向着对方呼啸而去。
Lin Xuan did not respond and circulated his spiritual power forming many pieces of hail and sending them whistling over to those two.

“哼，
雕虫小技！”
"Hmph, such a trifling skill!"

燕天衡脸上浮现出一丝阴狠的笑意，
他可是灵动期大圆满境界的高手，
岂会将冰弹诀这样的低阶法术放在眼里。
Yan Tian Heng showed a sinister smile. He was at the great perfection of the Spirit Gathering stage. How could he even look at such a low-level technique?

燕天衡单手平伸，
食指与拇指扣在一起，
口中念念有词，
体内灵力急速运转，
刹那间，
掌心的前面就出现了一团斗大的火焰，
然后变化成了鸟的形状。
Yan Tian Heng raised his arm and pinched his forefinger and thumb together and started chanting an incantation and circulating his spiritual power. Immediately, a huge ball of flames appeared upon his palm and then suddenly changed into the shape of a bird.

至于冰弹诀，
他连正眼都没有看，
打中灵力护盾，
也对自己造不成任何伤害。
As for the hail technique, he didn't even bother to look at it. Even if it struck his spiritual shield it would not do any harm to him.

火鸟术，
这可是火属性的中阶法术，
不愧是临近筑基的高手，
第一招，
就出手不凡。
Firebird technique is a fire type mid-rank technique. He was definitely worthy of being an expert one step away from Foundation Building. Even his opening move was extraordinary.

但林轩丝毫也不慌乱，
伸手一掏，
就又从怀中摸出了五张符，
冰冻术，
水火相克，
虽然这也是低阶法术，
但依靠数量，
以五敌一，
同样能与火鸟术拼个半斤八两没有问题。
But Lin Xuan did not panic at all. He once again reached into his bosom and fished out five more seals. Fire and water mutually suppress each other, and these five freeze seals, although there were all low-level seals, but relying on their numbers of five against one, it would still have, more or less, the same amount of power.

燕天衡瞪大了眼睛，
表情愕然，
又是惊奇，
又是愤怒，
实在太出乎意料了，
这小子究竟是何来历，
身上怎么会有那么多符？
Yan Tian Heng opened his eyes wide in shock. He was both surprised and angry. This brat was very unexpected. Just where exactly is he from that he could take out so many seals?

散修先排除，
便是宗派的精英弟子也不可能那么富有啊！
Not to mention rogue cultivators, even disciples of sects would not be this wealthy!

但无论如何，
也绝不能让他活着回去。
But not matter what, he could not let him live.

念及至此，
燕天衡发动了狂风骤雨般的攻击，
中阶法术一个接一个的向着林轩砸了过去。
Thinking of this, Yan Tian Heng launched a wild storm of attacks, one mid-grade technique after another flew towards Lin Xuan.

林轩神色漠然，
其实心中骇然，
不愧是第七层功法的高手，
此时此刻，
他知道自己当初用陷阱挂掉周燕是多么幸运了。
Lin Xuan had an apathetic look on his face but I his heart, he had to admit that Yan Tian Heng indeed worthy of being a seventh layer of cultivation expert. At this very moment, he knew how lucky he was to be able to take care of Zhou Yan with a trap back then.

如果不是周燕见自己功力低微，
太过轻敌，
连起码的护罩也没有开，
自己当初早就陨落在了小山谷里。
If it wasn't because of the fact that Zhou Yan underestimated him after seeing his weak cultivation and took him lightly, thus not even bothering to even raise a spiritual shield, then he would have fallen in that small mountain valley long ago.

而现在的燕家家主，
则是全力以赴，
丝毫没有可以取巧之处，
当然，
自己也不是那个功法在灵动期第一层徘徊的垃圾弟子了。
Yet the Yan patriarch was going all out and did not give him any opportunities to use any tricks. Of course, he was also not that trashy disciple that was stuck at the first layer anymore.

林轩又从怀里开始掏符，
他之所以不用本身的灵力运使法术是有原因的，
一来自己的进步虽然很大，
但时间太短了，
功力和对方相比，
整整的差了三层，
相印的，
灵力也就要弱很多，
而法术对轰，
技巧仅仅是辅助，
主要还是看谁的灵力更深厚，
自己既然弱于对方，
再以己之短攻敌之长岂不是找死？
Lin Xuan once again reached into his bosom for more seals. He was not using his own spiritual power to unleash techniques for a reason. Firstly, although he had made significant progress, but it had only been for a short time. His current cultivation, compared to the other, was a whole three layers short and his spiritual power was also much weaker. In a battle of techniques, skill was only secondary, the winner was mainly determined by who had more spiritual power. Since he was weaker than the other, if he used his weakness to fight against the opponent's strength, wasn't that simply looking for death?

其次，
林轩因为得到了灵器，
所以与普通弟子修炼的侧重点不同，
他只会少数几种法术。
Secondly, since he had acquired the spirit tools, his main focus in his cultivation has deviated from the other disciples. Therefore, he only learned a few techniques.

想要战胜强敌，
就要避实就虚，
与燕天衡相比，
自己的优点是什么，
符多。
To defeat the enemy, one must avoid the enemy's strong points and attack the weak points. Compared to Yan Tian Heng, what was his strong point? Too many seals.

既可以瞬发，
还只消耗很少的灵力，
面对比自己强的对手，
不用白不用。
Seals could be instantly activated and only used a minimal amount of spiritual power. Facing a stronger foe, it would be a waste not to use them.

至于冰针诀与灵器，
这两者可是自己的杀手锏，
既然这已经演变成了一场持久战，
那么底牌当然不能够轻易暴露了。
As for the Ice Needles technique and spirit tools, they were his trump cards. Since this has become a prolonged battle, then he could not easily reveal his ultimate attacks.

心中先将自己所面临的形势以及应该怎样作战，
做了一个大体的规划，
林轩平心静气，
不慌不忙的使用符箓，
与对方硬拼了起来。
He first made a general plan on how to deal with the current situation and a battle plan. Then remaining calm and relaxed, he unhurriedly started using more seals to deal with the Yan family.

轰，
轰，
轰……
Boom, boom, boom......

爆炸之声不绝于耳，
修真者间的战斗，
只能用激烈无比来形容，
燕天衡又惊又怒，
他虽然已经是大圆满顶点的高手，
可中阶法术非同小可，
灵力的消耗在急剧增加中，
法力下降极快，
可对方的符却像用不完似的，
这样下去……
The sounds of explosions rang out non-stop. The battle of cultivators could only be described as incomparably fierce. Yan Tian Heng was shocked and angry. Although he was at the great perfection of the Spirit Gathering stage, but using mid-rank techniques were no small matter. The spiritual power consumption was rapidly increasing and his spiritual power was rapidly dropping. But Lin Xuan was using seals as if he had an endless supply. If this continued......
