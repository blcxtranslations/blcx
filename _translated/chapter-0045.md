But not matter what, he was still his son. So Yan Tian Heng used one hand to pull his son behind him and raised the other in front of him. A light yellow coloured spirit power flowed from his body and changed into a spiritual shield.

Pop!

Popping sounds rang out as the fireballs collided with the spiritual shield. But immediately after, the fireballs disappeared. The blaze seal only contained a low-level technique. To want to break through the defense of the Yan family would take a lot more effort.

Seeing that his moves did not have any effect, Lin Xuan become increasingly more serious. He did not quickly continue his assault, to use techniques without knowing the others weaknesses would be useless.

To want to beat someone else, one first must learn how to be beaten. The battles between cultivators were very dangerous, one split second of inattention could cause one to lose their life, so one should first lay down their defenses. Seeing that his ambush had failed, Lin Xuan started to prepare for a prolonged battle.

He wasn't trash like that Yan Ming. Even if he was facing a strong foe, he was still able to calmly ponder his actions.

Lin Xuan did not hesitate. Circulating his spiritual power, he also formed a protective cover over his body. Then reaching into his bosom, he pulled out two seals. A wistful look flashed in his eyes, but immediately after, he became resolute and threw them into the air.

The first seal flashed brightly and changed into a humongous copper coin about Lin Xuan. He pointed his finger causing the copper coin to descend in front of him, shielding him from the front.

"Adamantine technique!"

The Yan family became agitated. This was a gold type mid-rank defensive technique and was very sturdy. How could a rogue cultivator have such a precious seal?

But just as he shouted out, the other seal also activated. It changed into a light blue coloured giant water bubble and wrapped around Lin Xuan.

"Water Spirit seal!"

This was also a mid-grade defensive technique!

When he originally heard from his son about the rogue cultivator that used a mid-grade pill to purchase a cultivation technique, even though there were many witnesses around to confirm it, he still was skeptical in his heart. But now he believed that there really was someone that did that. Using his experience of reading people, this youth in front of him wasn't a rogue cultivator. That kind of outfit was definitely used to try to fool other people.

"Just who exactly are you?" Yan Tian Heng stressed each syllable and had a sinister face.

Lin Xuan did not say anything. Since things were already like this, it could only end with one side or the other dying. There was no point in saying anything, only idiots would expose their own identities.

It was as if it had cost him an arm and a leg to use those two mid-grade defensive seals. It must be known that defensive seals were much harder than offensive seals to craft and therefore was much more precious.

Even though he had inherited these from Zhang Yu and Zhou Yan, there were only these two and he had just used them up.

Lin Xuan did not respond and circulated his spiritual power forming many pieces of hail and sending them whistling over to those two.

"Hmph, such a trifling skill!"

Yan Tian Heng showed a sinister smile. He was at the great perfection of the Spirit Gathering stage. How could he even look at such a low-level technique?

Yan Tian Heng raised his arm and pinched his forefinger and thumb together and started chanting an incantation and circulating his spiritual power. Immediately, a huge ball of flames appeared upon his palm and then suddenly changed into the shape of a bird.

As for the hail technique, he didn't even bother to look at it. Even if it struck his spiritual shield it would not do any harm to him.

Firebird technique is a fire type mid-rank technique. He was definitely worthy of being an expert one step away from Foundation Building. Even his opening move was extraordinary.

But Lin Xuan did not panic at all. He once again reached into his bosom and fished out five more seals. Fire and water mutually suppress each other, and these five freeze seals, although there were all low-level seals, but relying on their numbers of five against one, it would still have, more or less, the same amount of power.

Yan Tian Heng opened his eyes wide in shock. He was both surprised and angry. This brat was very unexpected. Just where exactly is he from that he could take out so many seals?

Not to mention rogue cultivators, even disciples of sects would not be this wealthy!

But not matter what, he could not let him live.

Thinking of this, Yan Tian Heng launched a wild storm of attacks, one mid-grade technique after another flew towards Lin Xuan.

Lin Xuan had an apathetic look on his face but in his heart, he had to admit that Yan Tian Heng indeed worthy of being a seventh layer of cultivation expert. At this very moment, he knew how lucky he was to be able to take care of Zhou Yan with a trap back then.

If it wasn't because of the fact that Zhou Yan underestimated him after seeing his weak cultivation and took him lightly, thus not even bothering to even raise a spiritual shield, then he would have fallen in that small mountain valley long ago.

Yet the Yan patriarch was going all out and did not give him any opportunities to use any tricks. Of course, he was also not that trashy disciple that was stuck at the first layer anymore.

Lin Xuan once again reached into his bosom for more seals. He was not using his own spiritual power to unleash techniques for a reason. Firstly, although he had made significant progress, but it had only been for a short time. His current cultivation, compared to the other, was a whole three layers short and his spiritual power was also much weaker. In a battle of techniques, skill was only secondary, the winner was mainly determined by who had more spiritual power. Since he was weaker than the other, if he used his weakness to fight against the opponent's strength, wasn't that simply looking for death?

Secondly, since he had acquired the spirit tools, his main focus in his cultivation has deviated from the other disciples. Therefore, he only learned a few techniques.

To defeat the enemy, one must avoid the enemy's strong points and attack the weak points. Compared to Yan Tian Heng, what was his strong point? Too many seals.

Seals could be instantly activated and only used a minimal amount of spiritual power. Facing a stronger foe, it would be a waste not to use them.

As for the Ice Needles technique and spirit tools, they were his trump cards. Since this has become a prolonged battle, then he could not easily reveal his ultimate attacks.

He first made a general plan on how to deal with the current situation and a battle plan. Then remaining calm and relaxed, he unhurriedly started using more seals to deal with the Yan family.

Boom, boom, boom......

The sounds of explosions rang out non-stop. The battle of cultivators could only be described as incomparably fierce. Yan Tian Heng was shocked and angry. Although he was at the great perfection of the Spirit Gathering stage, but using mid-rank techniques were no small matter. The spiritual power consumption was rapidly increasing and his spiritual power was rapidly dropping. But Lin Xuan was using seals as if he had an endless supply. If this continued......
