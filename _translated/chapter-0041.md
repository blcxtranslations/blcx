Using the medallion to open the restrictions, Lin Xuan returned to his room. As soon as he entered, he stood silently stood beside the bed and became gloomy. The reason was because originally, he wanted to simply waste some time in the cafeteria and wanted to see if he could hear any useful information. Who knew he would learn of such shocking news.

When he initially learned that there would be four mid rank techniques for sale in the afternoon session of the trades fair, he was in a great mood. Because his goal was simply to acquire the Spiritual Control technique that was included in these cultivation techniques. He did not have any requirements as to whether if it was a good or bad technique since it was only usable by Foundation Building cultivators and he was still far from that stage.

He only needed to learn the Spiritual Control technique, as to the mid rank cultivation techniques of Foundation Building, he only needed to think about that when the time came. It was still too early right now.

With this idea in mind, of the four techniques, he should not have a problem acquiring one of them.

But not......

According the that old man, of the four mid rank techniques, three of them have already been reserved by the cultivator clans. That only leaves one choice for him.

They were not like the low rank techniques of the Spirit Gathering stage. It was not often that a mid rank technique showed up and so they were in high demand. But the number of cultivator clans participating in this gathering were not limited to just three. The other clans and rogue cultivators are probably also aiming for that last mid rank technique and the difficulty of acquiring it for himself has also gone up greatly.

Although speaking in terms of spiritual medicine, Lin Xuan was confident he would not lose to anyone, but if he was to do that......

After being silent for a while, Lin Xuan clenched his teeth and decided that no matter what, he would not give up, he must get that mid rank technique.

Although Lin Xuan was generally cautious and like to plan before taking action, but this does not mean that Lin Xuan was a cowardly person. He was only like this because he did not want to provoke unnecessary trouble.

But if these things really happened and he had to make a choice, Lin Xuan would not be timid. Being a man, at the critical moment, you must know when to brave charge forward or to wisely retreat. If you were cowardly or afraid, you would not be able to do great things.

Since he was determined to win that mid rank technique, then there was no need to think too much about it.

Thinking of this point, Lin Xuan sat down cross legged to recover his spiritual power to the best condition. This way, if conflicts with others who wanted this cultivation technique occurred, his chances of winning would greater.

After almost an hour, Lin Xuan opened his eyes and left the house. Arriving at the plaza, he took a look around. There were nearly a hundred cultivators and arrived early to wait for the start of the trades fair. These were all people who had a treasure that they wanted and were afraid of other cultivators beating them to it.

Of these people, the majority of them were from the cultivator clans, only a few were rogue cultivators.

Lin Xuan rushed for a position towards the front and silently observed the surrounding cultivators. Unfortunately, no one was in the mood t chat, so he did not hear any gossip or news.

After a while, a cultivator wearing the clothing of the Soaring Cloud sect walked over and saluted the crowd. "Welcome fellow cultivators, the afternoon session of the trades fair will now begin......"

Those cultivators who absolutely wanted to acquire a treasure were not in the mood to listen to him drone, after seeing the restrictions being lifted on the plaza, they rushed in like bees.

Lin Xuan also did not delay and headed towards the south side of the plaza as described on the jade slip. Walking over, he saw that the stall selling the mid rank technique was exactly there.

"How much for this Frozen Heart technique?" See that the jade slip was still at the stall, Lin Xuan released a relived sigh because he did not come too late. But he did not show it on his face.

"You are?" The one responsible for the stall was a latter stage Spirit Gathering cultivator. Taking a look at Lin Xuan, he was curious, because this was a technique that could only be used if one was at the Foundation Building stage.

Of course Lin Xuan would not stupidly reveal his usage of it, so he slightly raised his chin in a proud manner and asked: "I asked you how much is it?"

His indifferent and haughty looked awed the other person. Although he was dressed like a rogue cultivator, but he had extraordinary bearing, it could be possible that he had powerful teachers backing him.

Thinking again of the fact that he wanted to purchase a cultivation technique that only Foundation Building cultivators could use, the owner of the stall immediately adopted a better attitude and smilingly said: "One hundred and fifty low grade Purified Essence pills."

Seeing that the stall owner changed his attitude, Lin Xuan secretly smiled, because that was his intention. Since this was the only mid rank cultivation technique left and a lot of other people wanted it, then being low key made no sense. It was better to be a little arrogant, this way, people would be unsure and might think he had powerful backing. This way he could add an extra layer of doubt.

But it went much better than expected, at least there were no other buyers. It seems that arriving early was the correct decision.

Lin Xuan reached into his bosom and was preparing to retrieve the pills. But at that moment, a frivolous voice sounded behind him. "One hundred and fifty Purified Essence pills, I'll take this Frozen Heart technique."

Lin Xuan's heart dropped. Who knew that in the end, there would still be an unexpected turn of events. Turning around with an expressionless face, he saw that it was a Spirit Gathering cultivator of about twenty seven or eight years old who was dressed like the son of a noble family.

His clothes along with his tiresome expression all pointed to the fact that he was a member of a cultivator clan.

Bang, Bang. Two jade bottles were thrown onto the stand. Then that young man reached out for the jade slip.

"Hold on." Linx Xuan shifted his body to block the youth.

"What?" Seeing that Lin Xuan was dressed like a rogue cultivator, the youth had a proud look on his face.

"Do you not understand first come first served?" Lin Xuan was too lazy to be long winded about this. Looking at their postures, neither sides were going to polite so they shed all pretenses of cordiality.

"Haha, first come first served. Can you, a rogue cultivator, even afford a mid rank technique?" The youth ridiculed. "Morevoer, even if you have the pills, do you dare to fight for it with my Yan family?"

Yan family was a medium sized cultivator clan. They did not have many people, only about a dozen cultivators. However, their patriarch was at the great perfection of the Spirit Gathering stage and was only a step away from the Foundation Building stage.

This knowledge of the Yan family flashed in his mind. Lin Xuan did not say anything else and retrieved the pills from his bosom. "One hundred sixty Purified Essence pills, I will take it."

Lin Xuan was willing to give ten extra pills because at the same price, the owner of the stall was definitely going to sell the cultivation technique to the cultivator clan and ignore the rogue cultivator. Unless he was will to reveal the fact that he was a disciple of the Floating Cloud valley but that was not possible.
