"Disband?" Lin Xuan was shocked: "You can avoid the catastrophe this way? Will that Core Formation senior stay his hand?"

"Of course." Li Hai was surprised and a little puzzled. He said: "Could it be that senior brother has not heard the commandment of the cultivation world?"

"Commandment?" Lin Xuan shook his head, showing an embarrassed expression, and said: "Little brother doesn't like to read books, and have never heard the seniors mention it. Could senior brothers advise me?"

Of course that was a lie. Lin Xuan often went to the library, but it was always for research. That is, books that were useful to cultivation he would read, but about this commandment of the cultivation world, this was his first time hearing it.

Lin Xuan was good a playing the fool, Li Hai bascially did not doubt him. He also really liked to talk and it was very rare for an advanced junior to ask him for advice. So playing right into Lin Xuan's hands, he started explaining again.

The cruelness of the cultivation world is well know. In the few years that Lin Xuan has been in the valley, although he had no experience of the outside world, but he kept his ears on the ground and his eyed peeled and heard a lot. There are still laws with in the sect, but there were not that many rules out in the cultivation world. Whoever has the bigger fist would be the boss, falsehood would become the truth, everything would be resolved by force.

Killing over disagreements or killing strangers for their treasures were things that happened everyday. Strictly speaking, good and evil does not exist, cultivators all relied on their strength, acting on their own whims.

But nothing was absolute, and even though acts of slaughter happened each day, but there was still a limit, and this was the commandment that Li Hai was talking about.

The commandment was thus: Between sects, or in disputes between sects and rogue cultivators, not matter what kind of hatred or feud, if one side concedes defeat, then they must, as a rogue cultivator, cripple their own cultivation, or as a sect, cripple every member's cultivation and also disband.

As long as they did this, it doesn't matter what kind of hatred the other party had, they were not allowed to make things difficult or seek revenge on them again. Otherwise, they would become the public enemy of the entire cultivation world and hunted down until their souls were scattered.

This is the iron rule, in tens of thousands of years, no cultivator had dared to violate it.

对于凡人来说，
除死无大事，
可对修真者来说，
失去力量，
成为碌碌无为的普通人才最痛苦，
这是比死更难的选择，
而且自废修为是不可逆的，
也就是说以后再也没有修真的希望了，
放过他们的一方也不用担心留下后患，
会被寻仇。

这天条已经延续了数万年，
是谁定下的，
为什么会定下现在已经说不清楚，
反正从来也没有人违背过，
其实对于百分之十的修真者与门派来说，
成为了高高再上的“仙师”，
都不愿再做回凡人，
宁为玉碎不为瓦全，
愿意自废修为的事情屈指可数。

所以凌云门虽然仅仅是四五流的小派，
可这个消息传出以后，
还是引起了轰动，
尤其是附近几千里范围内的修真者，
无不闻风而动，
准备参加宝物交易会。

“宝物交易会？”林轩顿时留上了神，
难道这就是刚才他们提到的出售筑基期用的阶功法，
虽然急切的想要探听情报，
不过表面上，
林轩却一点都没有表现出来，
随意的道：“什么是宝物交易会，
还请师弟指教。”

虽然相处才一会儿，
不过林轩已经看穿了厉海的性格，
这家伙属于藏不住话的那种，
只要自己随便点上一句，
他自然就会往下讲了。

不出所料，
厉海越说越兴奋，
旁边那个叫陈丰的几次想插嘴都插不上，
看着两人抢着说话，
将情报透露给自己，
林轩暗暗好笑，
神色自若的听他们介绍。

宝物交易会，
说白了非常的简单，
凌云门既然解散，
门内的众弟也自废修为变成了凡人，
那么门派的功法，
晶石，
灵器，
符箓等等对修真者来说重要的宝物自然也用不上了，
全部变卖出售。

只不过与修真者平常交易用晶石做为货币不同，
这种特殊的交易会，
只接受丹药，
原因无他，
晶石对于普通人也没有用啊，
而丹药就不同了，
修真者的各种灵丹，
不仅可以提升修为，
有助于修炼，
普通人吃了，
同样可以强身健体，
祛病延年。

凌云门的成员既然怕死，
情愿做一个普通人，
当然希望快乐的活久一点，
无病无灾，
所以就将他们成为凡人后用不到的各种宝贝换成丹药，
不仅自己一生受用不尽，
还可以传给孙后代，
保证家族的兴旺。

至于没有了修为，
又有大量丹药在身会不会惹上灾祸，
不用担心，
也有天条的保障，
修真者平时随便怎样杀人夺宝都属正常，
但对于这种自废修为，
成为凡人的修真者的东西却不准抢，
否则也会成为公敌，
被追杀致死。

凌云门虽然弱小，
但毕竟传承了上千年，
家底怎么也会有一些，
功法、晶石，
符箓，
各种材料，
甚至还有宝贵的灵器。

传说在一些修真门派众多，
修士繁盛的地域，
有修真者专门交换买卖东西的坊市，
不过飘云谷所在的赵国兖州，
方圆几千里，
只有寥寥几个修真小派，
散修的数量也很稀薄，
所以坊市是没有的，
这次凌云门的解散与宝物交易会，
顿时吸引了附近的修真者，
算是给大家提供了一个机会，
不仅可以来淘选凌云门的宝物，
还可以互通有无，
想必会非常热闹了。

将情报打听清楚以后，
林轩心欢喜，
真是踏破铁鞋无觅处，
得来全不费功夫，
在这样的交易会上，
肯定可以买到灵控术的修炼方法：“请问师弟，
这交易会何时，
又在哪个地方举行呢？”

“怎么，
师兄也想去购买宝物？”

厉海好奇的看了林轩一眼，
虽然这位赵师弟修为不凡，
但只是相对他的年纪，
一个灵动期应该没有什么可以交换的东西。

“呵呵，
当然不是了。”林轩可不会傻到暴露自己的意图：“愚兄怎么可能有东西交换呢，
最多看着眼馋，
我只是好奇，
才想要打听一下而已。”

这番话合情合理，
再加上林轩完美的骗人表情，
厉海和陈丰果然没有怀疑，
再一次解答了林轩想要知道的问题。
