The hardest technique, Ice Needles, has already been grasped, and the last technique, Imperial Wind, was much easier. Of course, this was a comparison, so it took Lin Xuan nearly a week to grasp.

Foundation Building cultivators can ride on their spirit tools, and travel thousands of kilometres a day. Spirit Gathering cultivators do not have this kind of ability. But the Imperial Wind spell was also extraordinary, take Lin Xuan as an example. With one movement, he could float nearly fifty meters, and jumping up, he could easily reach a height of close to twenty meters.

Using the Imperial Wind technique to travel, in the eyes of ordinary people, was already like flying. Also, after grasping this kind of technique, the body would become much more flexible. The benefits were obvious.

The perfect combination of offense, defense, and the support techniques greatly increased Lin Xuan's power.

After more than a month of practice, even though he wanted to break into the fifth layer, he stilled needed some more time. But with the dual assistance of his diligence and pills, Lin Xuan's spiritual power increased a lot. And apart from his daily cultivation, he continued to explore spirit tools.

......

Day after day flew by.

Holding the golden rope, with a gentle flick, Lin Xuan injected his spiritual power. It instantly lengthened, and under the control of his spiritual sense, it was dancing in the air like a spiritual snake.

Forward!

With a point of his finger, the golden rope accurately wrapped around the big tree in front of him. This was the mystic canyon, there was not enough space in his room to practice, so Lin Xuan quietly came to this deserted place.

After much hard work, he finally grasped this mid-grade spirit tool, however, looking at the golden rope that was wrapped around the tree, Lin Xuan was silent.

Standing still, he was silent for a while. Lin Xuan then waved his hand and recovered the golden rope. He had a pensive look on his face.

"Looks like my telekinesis is still not good enough."

On the surface, Lin Xuan looked very skillful controlling the golden rope. But according to the records in the books and the teachings of the elders of the sect, mid-grade spirit tools were much more powerful than this. His ability only allowed him to display at most ten or twenty percent of its power.

The reason for this situation was not because Lin Xuan lacked the spiritual power, but because there was a problem with the way he performed telekinesis.

Even though telekinesis allowed one to control spirit tools, it is still the most basic and most superficial, and only an entry level skill. If one really wanted to fully utilize the power of the spirit tool, then they would need to learn more advanced techniques.

But this difficult problem was placed in front of Lin Xuan. There was no way to learn such an advanced technique at the Young Hawks Pavilion!

The more advanced version of telekinesis is the Spiritual Control technique, which is a mid-rank technique. It should be stored on the second floor of the library and the only way to read it would be to meet one of the following two conditions.

Either reach the Foundation Building stage and become a high-level cultivator of the sect which naturally grants the qualifications to enter. But Lin Xuan directly rejected this idea. How can the path of cultivation be that easy? Even now, with the support of pills, to want to establish the foundation, would still require a long time.

And the second way, as a Spirit Gathering disciple, if one showed outstanding talent, and possessed a spirit tool, one can also petition the patriarch for admission onto the second floor of the library to consult the Spiritual Control technique.

On the surface, this seemed like a practical choice which could solve Lin Xuan's problem, but this is also a dead end. There is only one reason. After petitioning, if he wanted to be granted permission, then he must be tested. Although Lin Xuan's cultivation, compared to the other disciples of the sect, can be considered outstanding, but he would be hard pressed meet the requirements of the assessment.

Don't forget, Lin Xuan was not some genius, but the complete opposite. He couldn't be more ordinary and didn't even have spiritual roots.

A disciple without spiritual roots could actually outshine the majority of the other disciples. If this kind of situation came to light, it would be strange for those old foxes to not be suspicious.

If they discovered the star ocean in his dantian......

Lin Xuan would not put his head on the block like this.

Back then, when he took great pains to become a steward of DanXia mountain, the main purpose was, of course, for the waste pills. But that was not all, his other goal was to quietly go into hiding, to avoid notice.

Because usually, no one came to the waste pills storage room, those who willingly apply to become the steward were usually low levelled cultivators with no hope of making breakthroughs. Hiding among them, not only did he avoid notice, but he could also safely practice his cultivation.

For Lin Xuan to make this kind of decision was really to kill two birds with one stone.

By securing the source of pills, he could improve his cultivation without the scrutiny of others.

Of course, it was not one hundred percent safe, the only possible flaw was the fact that Lin Xuan went to the Young Hawks pavilion to listen to lectures.

That that cannot be helped, techniques must be learned. But Lin Xuan was very careful, each time he went, he picked the most remote corners.

To ascertain the cultivation of others, one must use their spiritual sense to check the other person. According to the established practices of the cultivation world, this was an act of hostility, and few would do it.

So even though a few months have passed, Lin Xuan's cultivation also jumped from the first layer to the fourth layer, but currently, no one had discovered that fact.

Of the two methods to enter the second floor of the library, either he could not fulfill it or he was afraid that someone would discover his cultivation level. Lin Xuan has met an unprecedented problem.

Is it okay to control spirit tools with telekinesis? It was barely adequate and could only display ten or twenty percent of its power. This was a clearly a reckless waste, and Lin Xuan was unwilling in his heart.

And even without considering spirit tools, he could surely require more advanced techniques to pair with his rising cultivation. To cultivators, spiritual power was the foundation, and techniques built upon this foundation. The two must complement each other and were indispensable. Only then could one display great power.

Although Lin Xuan does not have spiritual roots, he does have a great mind, or else he would be able to calculate every step before making decisions. But how, he really did face a conundrum.

Of course, Lin Xuan was not worried like others, one cannot solve problems while depressed, rather, it will make the situation worse. Every day, he still cultivated when it was time to cultivate, and purified pills when it was time to purify pills, conforming to his cultivation routine.

Only in his spare time, did he contemplate how to solve this problem in front of him.
