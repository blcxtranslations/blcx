Other than Ye Tian, there were also three other fellow disciples following after him. Of the three, two of them were short and stout and looked exactly alike; the other was tall and lanky with an ordinary appearance and looked somewhat dim-witted.

After hiding himself in the shrubbery, Lin Xuan did not make any movements and started to ponder. Of the disciples that entered the sect at the same time, Ye Tian was one of the outstanding talents. His cultivation could be ranked as one of the top five and was also someone that was spoiled and pampered by the elders. He normally looked down on everyone and treated the disciples that had lower cultivation than himself rudely. Why was he acting so out of character today?

Although this pair of brothers surnamed Song and that tall fellow possessed spiritual roots, they were rather weak. They only had the cultivation of the third layer. According to Ye Tian's character, he would not associate with these kinds of idiot disciples. What exactly was he planning?

Lin Xuan's curiosity had been piqued, so he silently released his spiritual sense so that he could see what was going on in greater detail.

"Senior Apprentice Brother Ye, is this the place where we are having the barbecue? Then I will go hunt some prey for us," said the elder of the two brothers with an excited expression on his face.

Ordinarily, they would receive no small amount of contemptuous and scornful looks. Since they were able to fawn upon this elite disciple, then they would have to perform well. Once they had the support of Ye Tian, they would also be treated better.

"There's no hurry."

Ye Tian smiled and patted his shoulder and retrieved a gourd from his storage bracelet. "After climbing such a tall mountain, you must be thirsty. I brewed this immortal wine myself. It contains many rare herbs and medicines and is very beneficial to raising one's cultivation. If Junior Apprentice Brothers do not mind it, then please have a taste."

"This......" Song Xiong was stunned and had an astonished expression on his face. He and his younger brother had already received such a great favour by being invited here by Ye Tian today. Ye Tian was an elite disciple valued by the elders and they had planned to fawn upon him and curry some favour, but who would have thought that he was even more enthusiastic than they were.

Hearing that this wine had the power to increase their cultivation, a greedy look flashed on their faces, but they still made excuses. "Senior Apprentice Brother, this is your precious treasure, how could we just take it without doing anything to deserve it?"

"Haha, we're all brothers, what are you saying this for? Drink!" Ye Tian had a forthright expression on his face while he waved his hands.

"Then I can only accept Senior Apprentice Brother's invitation." Song Xiong was never truly declining the invitation, so he received the wine gourd and proceeded to gulp a few mouthfuls.

Ye Tian had a slight smile on his face, along with a gentle expression. But secretly, a vicious and ominous look flashed in his eyes.

Song Xiong wiped his mouth and went to hand back the gourd. But Ye Tian did not accept it. "How can I favour one over the others? Junior Apprentice Brothers, you guys have some too."

"Many thanks, Senior Apprentice Brother."

The younger son of the Song family was called Song Hu. He had a much more rash temperament than his elder brother. After thanking Ye Tian once, he received the wine gourd and started gulping down the wine.

"Alright fellow apprentice brother Song, leave some for me." That tall and lanky youth was afraid that he would drink it all and hurriedly try to persuade him. After hearing this, Song Hu reluctantly relinquished the gourd.

The tall and lanky youth then started to madly drink from the gourd.

Lin Xuan watched with cold indifference and had a cold and mocking smile on the corner of his lips. Although he did not know what Ye Tian was planning, he definitely knew that it could not be something beneficial for those three. He had laid his trap and those three were desperate to get themselves caught in it.

Lin Xuan had a very good idea of what was going on yet he still did not intervene. Although with his current cultivation he should have no problems dealing with Ye Tian, but why should he meddle in other people's affairs?

Calamity is caused by opening one's mouth too much, and troubles are caused by rushing to the fore. Lin Xuan was not an inherently bad person, but he could not be called a good person either. Unless there were some benefits or gains, he would never meddle in other people's business.

The cultivation world was cruel and reeked of blood. Lin Xuan had long ago understood the principle that a wise man looks after his own hide.

No matter what the outcome was, he had no friendly relations with them, so those three could only shoulder it themselves. In addition, because they did not have good spiritual roots and were slow in cultivation, they were also ridiculed by the other disciples. But they themselves liked to bully those who had worse aptitudes then them. To now kick someone when they were down, Lin Xuan already thought that he was being nice. To do a good deed for those three evil persons was just a pipe dream. He was not that stupid.

"Senior Apprentice Brother Ye, we have finished the wine. Why don't you rest here while I go hunt for some prey."

Song Xiong still wanted to curry favour with Ye Tian. But just as he finished speaking, his expression suddenly changed. His body swayed and crashed to the ground.

"Elder brother!" Song Hu was shocked and wanted to help up his brother. But he also started to feel dizzy and was unable to stand up straight.

That tall and lanky disciple also consumed quite a bit of medicinal wine so he naturally also ended up in the same situation.

"Senior Apprentice Brother Ye, you......" These three were not fools, so naturally, they had figured out that Ye Tian had done something to the wine.

"Senior Apprentice Brother Ye, there is no hatred and animosity between us and we have never committed an offence against you!"

"That's right, Senior Apprentice Brother, maybe there was a misunderstanding and I would ask for your forgiveness."

......

The three of them were both shocked and angry, but they also understood that a wise man knows better than to fight when the odds were against him, so they could only implore for forgiveness. At the same time, they were all very baffled. They were merely at the third layer of the Spirit Condensation stage, even if they joined hands and acted together, they would not be able to defeat the fifth layer Ye Tian.

If he wanted to teach them a lesson, he wouldn't have to use such a bothersome and superfluous method like putting poison in the wine. Because they could not think of why he would do this, they started to panic.

The three of them secret channelled their spiritual power but found that they could not even utilize a single strand of it. This caused them to become much more panicked.

"Don't bother wasting your strength."

Ye Tian was fully content with his successful plan and finally exposed his vicious character. "You have just drunk the Spirit Sealing wine, within the next six hours, you won't be able to use any of your cultivation."

"Haha, why would Senior Apprentice Brother play this kind of joke?"

The murderous look on Ye Tian's face cause the three of them to very anxious, but after racking their brains, they still could not remember when they had offended him. Song Xiong could only weakly smile and hoped for the best.

"Hmph, who is joking with you?"

Ye Tian coldly said: "If you want to blame someone, then you can only blame your own bad luck. My Hundred Souls Streamer needs three more souls of cultivators to be completed. You guys have the fortune of being the offering for my magic treasure."

"Magic treasures? Offerings?"

Hearing these words, the three of them show expressions of extreme fear. They were trembling from head to toe and wanted to escape. But the Spirit Sealing wine not only sealed their spiritual power, it also had the secondary effect of marking the victim's body limp and sore. Therefore, all their efforts were in vain.
